            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Ive Leagues off from the City of <hi>Sivill,</hi> there is a
Towne called <hi>Caſtilblanco,</hi> and into one, of thoſe many Innes which
it hath, about the ſhutting in of the day when night was dtawing on, entred a
Travaylour, a ſtranger to that place, mounted upon a very handſome Nag, he
had no ſervant attending on him, and without ſtaying that any ſhould
hould his Stirrup, with great nimblenes he diſmounted himſelfe. The Hoſte
of the houſe made all the haſte he could unto him, (who was a diligent man
and carefull to give his Gueſts content) but for all the ſpeed he made he
came not in ſoone enough; in ſo much that this Travaylour was already
lighted from his horſe, and had ſate him down upon a bench which was in the
court, where falling a pace to the unbuttoning of his doublet<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58406:5"/>his armes fell preſently one one way, and another another giving a
manifeſt ſigne and token of fainting, and ſwou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. The Hoſteſſe
who was a charitable woman, ranne forth unto him, and ſprinkling his facc
with cold water made him come againe to himſelfe; and he making ſhow that
it did much trouble him that they had ſeene him in this taking, returned to
the buttoning up of his doubtlet, intreating that they would preſently bring
him to a lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whither he might with draw himſelfe, and that if it were
poſſible hee might be all alone. His Hoſteſſe told him that ſhee
had no more but one emptie in all the houſe, and that that too had two beds
in it, and that ſhee muſt be conſtrayned if any other Gueſts ſhould
come thither that night, to accommodate him in the one of thoſe two beds.
Whereunto this our Travaylour replyed, that hee would pay her for both the
beds, whether any gueſt came or not; and putting his hand into his Pocket,
and taking out a Crowne in gold, he gave it unto his Hoſteſſe, but with
this condition, that ſhe ſhould not let any one lye in the ſpare bed. His
Hoſteſſe was no whit diſpleaſed with her pay, but rather willingly
offered her ſelfe to doe that which hee deſired: yea, though the Deane
himſelfe of <hi>Sevill</hi> ſhould come that night to her houſe. Then did
ſhee aske him, whether he would ſuppe or no? he told her no; onely hee
entreated her that there might be an eſpeciall care taken of his Nag. He
called for the key of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and carrying up with him his Portmanteau,
he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred thereinto, and ſhutting the doore after him, hee tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the key
and lockt it. And to make the ſurer worke (by that which afterwards appeared)
hee had ſet two Chayers againſt it. He had ſcarce ſhut himſelfe up in
his Chamber, but that mine Hoſte and Hoſteſſe, and the Oſtler and two
other of their neighbours which were there by chance, layd their heads together
(as if they had beene ſo many grave Counſellours) and began to talke and
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the great beauty and ſprightfull diſpoſition of this 
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58406:5"/>their new gueſt, all of them concluding that they had
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in all their lives ſeene a fayrer or more beautifull Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Then
fell they to the reckoning up of his age, and their reſolution was, that it
was about 16. or 17. yeares or much thereabouts. Much prattle they had about
it, too and fro, off and on, and more particularly, what might be the cauſe
of that his fainting and ſwouning? But becauſe that was beyond their reach,
they reſted contented being rapt with admiration and wonder of his rare
proportion, and comlineſſe of perſon. The neighbours went away to their
owne houſe, the Hoſte to take eare of the Nag, and the hoſteſſe to
make ready ſomething for ſupper for ſuch other gueſts as might happily
come. And it was not long before another entred, ſomewhat but not much elder
then the former, and of no leſſe metall and ſpirit, and the
ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteſſe had even ſcarce ſeene him, when ſhee brake out into this
exclamation; God bleſſe me, what a ſtrange thing is this? Are
<hi>Angels</hi> come this night to lodge in my houſe? Why ſay you ſo
ſayd this new come gentleman to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteſſe? Sir ſayd ſhee, I doe
not ſay that for naught; onely I ſay unto you, that you will be pleaſed
to ſpare your ſelfe the labour of a lighting, becauſe I have never a bed
for you; for thoſe two which I had, a gentleman that lodgeth in that Chamber
there, hath taken them up, and hath payd mee for both, though hee hath neede
but of one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he will have none to be with him in his Chamber. And it
ſeemeth hee loveth ſolitarineſſe and ſhunneth company, but why and
wherefore I know not: for he hath ſuch a face and diſpoſition as ought
not to be hidden, but that all the world ſhould both ſee and prayſe it.
Is he ſuch and ſo handſome (mine hoſteſſe) as you ſpeake him to
be? (replyed the gentleman) ſuch? (quoth mine hoſteſſe) yes much more
then ſuch, ſince onely he is ſuch. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the gentleman replyed,
though I ſleepe all night on the bare floore, I am reſolved to ſee this
curious peece by you ſo highly commended, and calling to his man, who 
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58406:6"/>came along with him, willing him to holde his
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, hee allighted, and gave order
to have his ſupper made ready as ſoone as poſſibly they could, which
was done in a trice: And whilſt hee was ſitting at ſupper, comes me in an
<hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quazil</hi> of the Towne, (as ordinarily they uſe to doe in little
Villages,) and ſate him downe by this gentleman to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with him, and
keepe him company till he had made an end of his ſupper, and betweene whiles
hee did not (for all his diſcourſing) forbeare to trill downe three good
gob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets of Wine, and tire upon the braines and cradle of a Partridge which the
gentleman gave him, which kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe the <hi>Alquazil</hi> thought he had
requited to the full by asking him, what newes at Court? how the warres went on
in <hi>Flanders?</hi> and whether the <hi>Turk</hi> were not making great
preparation for his comming downe into Chriſtendome? not forgetting to
queſtion him touching <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> how things ſtood there,
&amp;c. The gentleman had by this time ſupt, and was ſilent all the while,
becauſe hee was unaquainted with thoſe paſſages, and therefore could
not ſatisfie him in thoſe his demands. Now likewiſe by this time had mine
hoſte ended the provendring of the Nag, and came and ſate himſelfe downe
to make a third in this their converſation, and to fall a taſting of his
owne wine, gulping downe no leſſe then the <hi>Alquazil,</hi> and after
every cup that hee tooke he would wry his head, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it on his left
ſhouder, and highly commending the wine, ſayd that it carried him into the
Clouds, though hee durſt not ſtay any long time in them, leaſt hee
ſhould have too much water in his wine. And ever and anon he fell a
reiterating the prayſes of his gueſt that had ſhut up himſelfe, telling
them of his ſwouning, and that he would have nothing to his ſupper,
exaggerating all things in an exceſſive kinde of manner. Hereunto hee added
what Portmanteu hee had, and the goodneſſe of his Nag, and what a daintie
riding ſute; all which did require that hee ſhould not travaile thus
without a man to waite upon<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58406:6"/>him. All theſe exaggerations did
ſtirre up a new deſire in the other to have a ſight of him, and intreated
his hoſte that he would by one meanes or other ſo bring the
buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe about, that he might get into the chamber and lye in that
other bed, and that he would give him a Crowne in Gold for his paines. And
although the greedineſſe of gaine had already wrought the effect even upon
mine Hoſts will, yet he found it was not ſeaſonable by reaſon that hee
had ſhut in himſelfe, neither durſt he awaken him out of his ſleepe,
having likewiſe conſidered with himſelfe, that he had payd well for both
the beds; all which rubs the <hi>Alquazil</hi> did remove, making the way very
facile and eaſie: Telling them that which may, and is to be done, is this, I
will knock at the doore, ſaying that I am the Iuſtice, &amp; that by the
command of my maſter the <hi>Alcalde</hi> I was willed to bring this
gentleman to lodge in this Inne, and that there being no other bed for him, his
will and pleaſure was that hee ſhould have that; whereupon mine Hoſte
muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, aggravating the great wrong and injury that is done him, being
that he had rented the chamber and bed of him, and that there was no reaſon
in the world why hee ſhould not freely enjoy that which hee was poſſeſt
of, and had payd ſo well for it; ſo by this meanes mine hoſte ſhall be
blameleſſe, and your worſhip ſhall obtaine your purpoſe. This plot of
the <hi>Alquazil</hi> was very well liked and approved by all of them. And the
gentleman who had a longing deſire to ſee this rare Iewell, incloſed as
it were in a caſe, gave the <hi>Alquazil</hi> foure Royalls in Requitall of
his readineſſe to doe him this deſired ſervice. Whereupon he
preſently puts his plot in execution, and in concluſion the firſt gueſt
ſhewing great riſentment, removing the chayres and unlocking the doore,
opened it to the Iuſtice: And the ſecond gueſt craving pardon of the
wrong which hee might conceive hee had done him, went and layd him downe in the
leere bed. But the other returned him not ſo much as one word in anſwer
thereunto, much leſſe<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58406:7"/>would he ſuffer him to ſee his
face, for he had ſcarce ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the doore, but he hy'de himſelfe with all
the haſte hee could to his bed, and turning his face to the wall, that hee
might not anſwer him, made as though hee were aſleepe: the other alſo
betooke him to his reſt, hoping in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning when they were to get up to
accompliſh his deſire; The nights were of thoſe long and large ones of
<hi>December,</hi> and the coldneſſe of the weather and the wearineſſe
of their journey, might inforce Travail ours to procure to them paſſe over
with ſweete repoſe. But becauſe the firſt gueſt knew not what eaſe
or reſt was, anon after midnight he began to ſigh ſo grievouſly, that
with every ſigh he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ſend his ſoule from out his body, and
ſo deepely were they fetcht from the heart roote, that though the ſecond
gueſt were faſt aſleepe, he could not chuſe but be wakened with the
pitifull ſound of the complainant. And wondring at the ſobs and throbs,
wherewith hee accompanied thoſe his ſighs, he attentively ſet himſelfe
to liſten unto that, which to his ſeeming hee whiſpered and muttered to
himſelfe. The roome was darke, and the beds in a good diſtance the one from
the other, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, he came to heare amongſt other
his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſings, theſe inſuing, which with a weake and feeble voyce
were uttered by the firſt afflicted gueſt.</p>
            <p>Ah me! of all other I moſt unfortunate! Whither doth the
unreſiſtable force of my deſtiny carry me? what courſe is this which I
runne? or what hope have I to part out of this intricate Laberinth wherein I
finde my ſelfe? O my few and ill expired yeares, incapable of all good
conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and counſell. What end will this my unknowne p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>grination have? O my contemned and
deſpiſed ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, how lightly have I ſet by thee? O my ill requited love!
O how have I troden under foote the reſpects that I owed to my noble Parents
and kinsfolke! And ah mee, a thouſand and a thouſand times that I have with
ſo looſe a reyne ſuffered my ſelfe to be carryed away by my deſires!
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58406:7"/>O yee feigned words, which did ſotruly and really obleige
me, that by my workes and deeds I ſhould correſpond with you! But alas
poore miſerable perplexed wretch that I am, of whom doe I complaine? To whom
doe I make my moane? Am not I the perſon that was ſo willing to deceive my
ſelfe? Am not I the partie that to oke the knife with mine owne hands, where
with I did cut off my cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and throw it on the ground, and together
therewith, the reputation and worth of my ancient parents? O faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<hi>Marco Antonio,</hi> how is it poſſible that in thoſe ſweete words
which thou uttredſt unto me, the gall ſhould bee mingled of thy
diſcourteſies and diſdaines? O thou un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull where art thou? whither
forgetfull of me, art thou gone? Anſwere me, for I ſpeake unto thee; uphold
me, for I am ready to fall, pay me that which thou oweſt me; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me in
my diſtreſſe ſince I have ſo many wayes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiged thee unto me.
Having ſayd this ſhee was ſilent; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting by her ſighes and
groanes that her eyes did not ceaſe to ſhower downe teares in aboundance.
All which this ſecond gueſt lay liſtning unto with a ſtill and quiet
ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; collecting by thoſe diſcourſes which he had heard, that
without doubt it was a woman that did thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine and bewayle her wretched
condition; which ſerved as a coale to kindle the more the deſire he had of
knowing her; and he had often reſolved with himſelfe to goe on to her bed,
being fully perſwaded ſhee was a woman. And doubtleſſe he had done it,
if in that very inſtant he had not heard him riſe, and opening the chamber
doore call to the Hoſte of the houſe to ſaddle his Nagge, becauſe he
would preſently bee gone. To whom mine Hoſte, after ſuffering himſelfe
a good while to bee called upon, made anſwere, that hee ſhould goe ſleepe
and take his reſt, for it was not yet midnight, or but a little paſte, and
that it was ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding dark that it were great raſhnes and
indiſcretion to put himſelfe upon his journey. With this hee reſted
qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, and returning to ſhut the doore, hee did not lay, but
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58406:8"/>throw himſelf all at once down upon the bed, ſending
forth with all a ſtrong ſigh. It ſeemed unto him that heard him not
amiſſe to ſpeake unto him, &amp; to offer himſelfe to procure his
remedy, as far forth as on his part he was able to performe; to the end he
might obleige him thereby to diſcover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and to recount unto him
the lamentable hiſtory of his misfortune: And therefore ſayd unto him;
Certainly (noble Sir) if the ſighs which you have vented, and the words which
you have uttered had not moved mee to a fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling and condoling of that
evili, whereof you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, I ſhould thinke with my ſelfe that I wanted
na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall compaſſion, or that my ſoule were of ſtone, and my breſt of
hard braſſe. And if this compaſſion vvhich I have of you, and if the
purpoſe vvhich I have put on to hazard my life for your remedy, (in caſe
your maladie requireth it) may merit any courteſie in recompence thereof, I
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you that you vvill uſe it vvith mee, by declaring unto mee
vvithout covering or concealig any thing from me, the cauſe of your
ſorrovv. If my ſorrovv had not bereft me of my ſenſe (anſvvered hee
that complained) I might very vvell have bethought my ſelfe that I was not
all alone in this lodging, and therefore ſhould have put a bridle to my
tongue, and made a longer truce with my ſighs: But in puniſhment of my
memories fayling mee, and in ſuch a place, where it ſo much imported mee to
have lookt better unto it, I will doe that which you deſire mee; becauſe by
renewing the ſad ſtory of my misfortunes, it may be that a new ſenſe,
and freſh feeling of them will make an end of me. But if you will that I doe
that which you deſire mee, you ſhall promiſe. mee by that faith which you
have profeſt unto mee in that offerture which you have made mee, and that as
you are a Gentleman, and by that inbred goodneſſe which is in you, (for by
that which your words expreſſe you, you promiſe much) that for the things
which you heare from me, and which I ſhall tell you, you move not out of your
bed, nor come unto <pb n="9" facs="tcp:58406:8"/>mine, nor aske more of me, then what I
ſhall bee willing to tell you; for if you ſhall doe contrary thereunto, in
that very inſtant that I heare you ſtirre or move, with a Sword which I
have at my beds head, I will runne my ſelfe through the body. The other (who
would not ſtick to promiſe a thouſand impoſſibilities, for to know
that which he ſo much deſired) made anſwer, that he would not in any the
leaſt Title differ from that which he deſired, confirming the ſame with a
thouſand oathes. Vpon this ſecuritie the firſt gueſt ſayd unto him, I
will now doe that which hitherto I never did to any, to wit, to give you an
account of my life, and therefore hearken unto it.</p>
            <p>Sir, I muſt give you to underſtand that I who entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this lodging (as no doubt but they have told you) in mans attire, am an
unfortunate Damſell, at leaſt one that was ſo, not full eight dayes agoe,
but have now loſt that noble name by mine unadviſedneſſe and
fooliſhneſſe, and by giving credit to the well compoſed, but
counterfeit words of faithleſſe men. My name is <hi>Theodoſia,</hi> my
coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey one of the chiefeſt and prime places of all <hi>Andaluzia;</hi>
whoſe name I ſilence (becauſe it doth not ſo much import you to know
it, as it doth me to conceale it.) My parents are noble, and more then meanely
rich; who had betweene them one ſonne and one daughter; he, for to be a
ſtaffe to reſt themſelves on in their old age, and an honour to their
houſe, and ſhee, the cleane contrary. They ſent him to
<hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manca</hi> to ſtudy, and me they kept at home, where they bred mee
up with ſuch warineſſe and circumſpection as beſt became their vertue
and nobleneſſe, and I without any repining or grudging was alwayes obedient
unto them, conforming my will unto theirs without erring therefro in any
leaſt point, till that my happineſſe being in the Wane, or my misfortune
growing towards the Full, a ſonne of one of our neighbours, more rich then my
parents and no leſſe noble then they, preſented himſelfe to mine eyes.
The firſt time that I ſaw him, I was not ſenſible of any 
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58406:9"/>thing elſe, ſave onely a complacencie and kinde of
pleaſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in having ſeene him, neither was it much that I ſhould be
ſomewhat taken therewith, becauſe his bravery, gentle carriage, face, and
faſhion were of the moſt, praiſe-worthy and beſt eſteemed in thoſe
parts, receiving ſome further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition by his rare diſcretion and
courteſie. But what does it avayle me to prayſe mine enemy, or to goe, by
way of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, inlarging this my unfortunate ſucces, or (to ſay
better) the beginning of my folly? In concluſion, I ſay, that he ſaw me
not once but often from a window that was right over againſt mine. From
thence (as it ſeemed then unto me) he ſent his ſoule unto me by his eyes,
and mine, with another kind of content then at firſt, tooke pleaſure and
delight in beholding him, and did even enforce me to beleeve that they were
pure truths which I read in his face and behaviour. His eyes, were the
interceſſours and procurers of ſpeech, his ſpeech, the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter of
his deſire, his deſire, the inflamer of mine, and of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith and
beleefe unto his. To theſe he added promiſes, oathes, teares, ſighs and
all that which to my ſeeming a firme and conſtant lover could poſſibly
doe, for to expreſſe the integretie of his loving affection, and the
ſtedfaſtneſſe and ſinceritie of his heart and minde. And in me (poore
ſoule) who had never ſeene my ſelfe in the like occaſions, and
dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous adventures heretofore, every word, was a Canon ſhot which did
batter down a part of the Forte of mine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; every ſcalding teare, was a
flaming fire wherein my honeſty was ſcorched and burnt; every ſigh, a
furious wind which did in ſuch ſort augment the flame, that it came to
conſume that vertue which untill then had beene never touched; and laſtly,
having plighted his faith and truth to me to bee my husband in deſpight of
his parents (who had provided another wife for him) I did ſet all my
reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rednes at ſix and ſeavens, not caring which way the world went: and,
without knowing how my ſelfe, I delivered o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver my ſelf into his power (my
parents being unacquainted therewith) without having any other witneſſe of
my<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58406:9"/>folly, and inconſiderate raſhneſſe, then <hi>Marco
Antonio</hi> his Page, (for this is the name of the diſturber of my reſt
and quietude) and ſearſe had he taken of me the poſſeſſion of that
which hee ſo much deſired, but that within two dayes after he diſappeared
and was gone, neither his parents, nor any other perſon being able to tell or
imagine which way he tooke, or what was become of him. In what a woefull caſe
I was, let him ſpeake that is able to ſpeake it, for I know not, nor ever
knew more, ſave onely to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayle and lament it. I did chaſtiſe my hayres
as if they had beene in fault, and guilty of my errours; I did marty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe my
face, becauſe I conceived that it had given the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of all my
miſhap. I curſed my fate, accuſed my too quick determination, I did
ſhed many and infinite teares, I ſaw my ſelfe even almoſt choaked
betwixt them and thoſe ſighes which vented themſelves from forth my
grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſoule: I ſilently complayned on heaven, I reaſoned and
diſcourſed with mine imagination, to ſee if I could diſcover any way or
part that might leade to my remedy. And that which I found was, to put my
ſelfe into mans apparrell, and in that diſguiſed habit to abſent my
ſelfe from the houſe of my parents, and to goe ſeeke out this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Impoſter <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and this cruell and faithleſſe <hi>Viveno,</hi>
this defrauder of my good thoughts, and of my lawfull &amp; well grounded
hopes, and ſo without ſounding to the bottome, or diving any deeper into my
diſcourſings, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion offering me a riding ſuite of my Brother, and a
Nag of my Fathers, which I ſadled in an exceeding darke night, I got me
packing, with purpoſe to goe to <hi>Salamanca</hi> where (as it was
afterwards told me) it was thought <hi>Marco An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio</hi> might hap to be; for
he likewiſe is Student there (as before I told you) and my brothers
chamber-fellow. Nor did I omit to take good ſtore of Crownes with me,
againſt all chances that might befall me in this my unthought on journey. But
that which doth moſt trouble me, is, leaſt that my parents ſhould follow
after me, and finde me out<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58406:10"/>by my cloathes, and by the Nag
which I have brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with me. But put caſe I did not feare this, yet
am I afrayd of my brother, who is in <hi>Salamanca,</hi> by whom if I come to
be knowne, the perill is eaſie to bee apprehended, whereunto my life is put
for though he may heare my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes in my diſcharge, yet the leaſt point
of his honour will weigh downe the ballance, and overſway all the
ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that I ſhall bee able to give him. Notwithſtanding all
this, my principall determination is (though I looſe my life in the
purſuite) to ſeeke out this falſe hearted man my husband, for hee cannot
deny himſelfe ſo to be, unleſſe he will give the lye to thoſe pledges
which hee left in my power, which are a Ring of Diamonds, and the Poeſie
ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, ſpeaking thus: <hi>Marco Antonio, is Theodoſia's Husband.</hi> If
I meet with him, I will put him to the queſtion vvhat it vvas that moved him
ſo quickly to leave me? And in concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I am fully reſolved that hee
ſhall comply vvith his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed vvord and faith made unto me, vvhich if he
refuſe to doe, I will kill him; ſhevving my ſelfe as ready to take
revenge, as I was facile in ſuffering him to wrong me. For that
nobleneſſe of blood which my parents have given me, goes rovvſing up my
ſpirits, and puts ſuch metall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, that they already promiſe me
eyther a remedy of my received vvrong, or a full revenge of my offered
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front. This (noble Sir is the true and unfortunate Hiſtory vvhich you ſo
much deſired to knovv, vvhich may ſufficiently pleade the excuſe of
thoſe ſighs and vvords which did avvake you out of your ſleepe. That
vvhich I novv beg and intreace of you, is, that ſince you cannot give me any
remedy, yet at leaſt you will give mee your beſt counſell and adviſe,
whereby I may be able to avoyd thoſe dangers which may oppoſe themſelves,
and ſtand in my way, and to qualifie and moderate the feare which I have of
being found out, and to facilitate the means which I am to uſe for the
obtayning of that, which I ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and ſtand in neede of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:58406:10"/>Hee who had attentively hearkned to the
Hiſtory of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amored <hi>Theodoſia,</hi> continued a great while without
retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning her ſo much as one word, &amp; ſo long that ſhe thought he was
aſleepe, and that hee had heard nothing of all that ſhee had ſayd. And
for to certifie her ſelfe of that which ſhee ſuſpected, ſhee ſayd
unto him; Sleepe you Sir? Indeede it is not amiſſe, that you ſhould
ſleepe, becauſe the grieved and afflicted perſon, who recounteth his
miſeries and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes to him that is not ſenſible of them, it is
meete that they ſhould cauſe in him that heareth them rather ſleepe then
pitty.</p>
            <p>I ſleepe not replyd the Gentleman, but rather am ſo broad
awake, and ſo ſenſible of your diſadventure, that I doe not know,
whether it may bee ſayd that it grieveth mee in the ſelfe ſame degree as
it doth you; and therefore the counſell which you crave of me ſhall not
only end in adviſing you, but in helping you as far forth as my abilitie and
ſtrength ſhall inable mee. But ſeeing that in the manner which you have
held in recounting unto me your ſucceſſe, you have manifeſted the rare
underſtanding wherewith you are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed, me thinkes, that anſwerable
thereunto, your owne rendred up wil ſhould not have ſo mightily miſ-led
you: ſo that it ſeemeth your own inclination and willingneſſe did more
deceive you, then <hi>Marco Antonio</hi> his perſwaſions. Yet
notwithſtanding I amcontent to take in excuſe of your er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, thoſe your
few and tender yeares which for want of experience cannot come to diſcerne
the manifold de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of men. Gentlewoman patient your ſelfe, goe, take your
reſt, and ſleepe if you can, during this ſmall remnant of night, and when
the day ſhall come on, wee two will lay our heads together, and ſee what
courſe is beſt to bee taken for to give you remedy. <hi>Theodoſia</hi> in
the beſt lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage ſhe could deliver, acknowledged her thankfulneſſe,
and ſetled herſelfe to reſt a while, that ſhee might give way to the
Gentleman to ſleepe. But it was not poſſible for him to take any reſt,
but hee rather began to toſſe and<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58406:11"/>tumble too and fro in
the bed, and to ſigh in ſuch ſort that <hi>Theodoſia</hi> was inforced
to aske him, what he ayled? And that if it were ſome paſſion whereunto
ſhee might apply any remedy, ſhee would doe it with the ſame
willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe as hee had offered unto her. Hereunto the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
anſwered, ſuppoſe (Gentlewoman) that you are ſhe which cauſeth that
diſquietneſſe which you have percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in mee, yet you are not ſhee
that are able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy it: For could you bee ſhee I ſhould not feele any
paine at all. <hi>Theodoſia</hi> could not well underſtand whether thoſe
confuſed reaſons tended, yet notwithſtanding ſhee ſuſpected that
ſome amourous paſſion did trouble him: And thought with her ſelfe that
ſhe was the cauſe, and ſhe might with ſome reaſon ſuſpect and
thinke ſo, ſince that the commoditie of the lodging, the ſolitude and
darkenes of the roome, and ſhee being now knowne to bee a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, it had
beene no ſuch great wonder that it ſhould awaken and ſtirre up in him
ſome evill motions. And therefore being fearefull thereof, ſhe made her
ſelfe ready in great haſte, and with much ſilence and ſtillneſſe,
and tooke to her her ſword and dagger, and being thus armed ſitting downe
upon her bed, ſhee continued in that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture expecting day, which within a
little while after gave tokens of his comming by that light which entred in by
many chinkes and crevices, which commonly all your lodgings in Innes are
ſeldome without. And what <hi>Theodoſia</hi> did, the ſame did the
Gentleman, for he no ſooner ſaw the lodging ſtarrifyed with the day light
peeping through thoſe many little holes, but hee forth with roſe from his
bed, ſaying, Ariſe Miſtris <hi>Theodoſia,</hi> for I will accompany you
in this your journey, and will never let you goe from my ſide, untill that
you have <hi>Marco Antonio</hi> to be your law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full husband, or that eyther hee
or I will looſe our lives, And by this ſhall you know the obligation and
willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, whereinto your misfortune hath put mee. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſayd
this, he opened the windowes and doores of<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58406:11"/>the Chamber.
<hi>Theodoſia</hi> was well pleaſed therewith, longing to ſee by the
cleareneſſe of that light, what manner of man he was with whom ſhee had
held diſcourſe all that night. But when ſhee had viewed him and knew him,
ſhee then wiſhed that it had never beene day, but that there her eyes had
beene cloſed and ſhut up in perpetuall night. For the Gentleman had
ſcarce turned his eyes towards her to behold her, (for he likewiſe did
deſire to ſee her) but ſhee preſently perceived, that it was her
brother of whom ſhee was ſo much afraid. With whoſe ſight ſhee had
almoſt loſt that of her owne eyes, and remayned ſuſpenſive and
ſpeechleſſe, and without any colour in her cheekes. But drawing from
feare courage, and from danger diſcretion, pulling out her Dagger, ſhee
tooke it into her hand by the point, and humbling her ſelfe on her knees
before her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhee ſpake unto him with a troubled and timerous
voyce, ſaying; Take this my beloved brother) and worke on me with this
ſharpe pointed Iron the chaſtiſment of that folly which I have committed,
ſatisfying therewith thy diſpleaſure, ſithence that for ſo great a
crime as mine, it is not fit that any mercy ſhould bee extended towards me. I
confeſſe my offence, acknowledge my ſinne, but would not that my
repentance ſhould ſerue to excuſe my fault. Onely I beſeech you that
the puniſhment may be ſuch, as may take away my life, but not mine honour;
for although I have put it into manifeſt perill, by abſenting my ſelfe
from my fathers houſe, yet notwithſtanding it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eſcape opinion, if
the chaſtiſement which you give ſhall not be ſecret.</p>
            <p>Her brother looked ſteadily on her, and thought the
looſeneſſe of her audaciouſneſſe did incite him to revenge, yet
thoſe her ſo tender and effectuall words, wherewith ſhe manifeſted her
faulte, did in ſuch ſort mollifie his bowels, and worke ſuch
compaſſion in him, that with a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing countenance and chearefull
ſemblance, hee rayſed her up from the ground, and comforted her the beſt
he either<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58406:12"/>could or knew; telling her (amongſt other
ſpeeches which he uſed unto her) that becauſe he could not finde out a
puniſhment anſwerable to her folly, he would ſuſpend it for the
preſent, and that therefore as well in reſpect of that, as alſo for that
it ſeemed unto him, that <hi>Fortune</hi> had not as yet wholly ſhut the
doores againſt giving her remedy, he rather made choyſe to procure it her
by all poſſible meanes, then to take revenge of that wrong, and affront,
which by her overmuch lightneſſe and credulitie reflected upon him. With
theſe kinde words <hi>Theodoſia</hi> began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover her loſt
ſpirits, her colour returned to her face, and her almoſt dead hopes were
quickned and revived. <hi>Don Rafael</hi> (for ſo was her brother called) was
not thence forward willing to treate any more with her touching her
diſaſter, knowing how harſh that note would ſound in her eares, onely
he adviſed her that ſhe would change that her name of <hi>Theodoſia</hi>
into <hi>Theodoro,</hi> and that they would both of them goe forthwith to
<hi>Salamanca</hi> to looke out <hi>Marco Antonio,</hi> albeit he imagined that
he was not there; becauſe being his chamber fellow he would have acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him with his going thither, though it might be that the wrong which he had done
him in his ſiſter did not onely make him conceale it, but to have no
deſire at all to ſee him. This our new <hi>Theodoro</hi> referred her
ſelfe wholly to that which ſtood with her brothers pleaſure. And now (for
a Parentheſis) comes in mine Hoſte, whom they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, that he ſhould
make ready their breakfaſt, for they would preſently bee gone. In the
Interim that their beaſts were ſadling, and breakfaſt come in, there
entred into the Inne a Gentleman a Travaylour, who was inſtantly knowne by
<hi>Don Rafael. Theodoro</hi> likewiſe knew him, but durſt not come out of
the lodging for feare of being ſeene. Theſe two lovingly imbraced each
other, and <hi>Don Rafael</hi> asked this new commer, what newes there was in
thoſe parts from whence he came. To whom hee made anſwer, that he came from
the port of <hi>Santa Maria,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:58406:12"/>where he left foure
Gallies that were bound for <hi>Naples,</hi> and that in them he ſaw imbarked
<hi>Marco Antonio Adorno,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Don Leonardo Adorno,</hi> with
which newes <hi>Don Rafael</hi> was wonderfull well pleaſed, conceiving, that
ſince ſo without any further trouble, hee came to have knowledge of that
which did ſo much concerne him, it was a ſigne that the buſineſſe he
had in hand would have a good end. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated his friend that hee would
exchange his Mule with him for his fathers Nag, telling him that hee was to goe
to <hi>Salamanca,</hi> and was loath to carry along with him ſo good a Nag
ſo long a journey. The other who was a well bred man, and his friend was
content to exchange with him and tooke it to his charge to deliver the Nag to
his father. They two brake faſt together, and <hi>Theodoro</hi> alone by
himſelfe, and the time of parting being come, they tooke their leave each of

<hi>Cazalla,</hi> where he had a goodly Lordſhip, <hi>Don Rafael</hi> did not
goe out with him, and that hee might the better give him the ſlip, he told
him that he muſt needs returne that day to <hi>Sevill.</hi> And therefore as
ſoone as he was gone, their beaſts being brought forth, having made their
reckoning, &amp; payd their hoſt, ſaying <hi>Adieu,</hi> they rode forth of
the Inne, leaving as many as remayned therein, wond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing at his great beauty &amp; gentle
carriage; who for a man had no leſſe gracefulnes, metalland ſweetnes of
behaviour then his ſiſter. They were no ſooner gone thence, but <hi>Don
Rafael</hi> told her the newes which he had received concerning <hi>Marco
Antonio,</hi> and that he thought it fit that with all poſſible diligence
they ſhould make for <hi>Barcelona,</hi> where ordinarily the Gallies which
ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſe into <hi>Italy</hi> or come for <hi>Spaine,</hi> ſtay a day
or two; and in caſe they were not as yet come they might ſtay &amp; expect
their arrivall, &amp; that there without doubt they ſhould finde <hi>Marco
Antonio.</hi> His ſiſter ſaid unto him that he ſhould doe what liked
him beſt, for her will was his. <hi>Don Rafael</hi> then cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to the
<hi>Muletere,</hi> whom he brought along with him told him that he muſt have
patience, for it ſtood him upon to goe to <hi>Barcelona,</hi> aſſuring
him that he would give him good <pb n="18" facs="tcp:58406:13"/>content, and pay him well
for the time he ſhould continue with him. The <hi>Muletere,</hi> who was a
good follow, &amp; as blithe a lad as any of his function, and one who knew,
that <hi>Don Rafael</hi> was a liberall gentleman, made anſwer that he would
goe with him to the end of the world, and do him the beſt ſervice he could.
Hereupon <hi>Don Rafael</hi> demanded of his ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter what moneys ſhe had
brought along with her? ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed that ſhe had not told them, &amp; that
ſhe knew no more concerning them, ſave that they had put her hand into her
fathers Cabinet ſeven or eight times, and tooke it out full of Piſtolets,
&amp; according to that quantity, <hi>Don Rafael</hi> imagined that it might
bee a matter of ſome 500. Crownes, which with other two hunded which hee had,
and a chayne of Gold which he wore about his necke, he thought himſelfe very
well provided: And the better, for that he verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded himſelfe that
he ſhould meet with <hi>Marco Antonio</hi> in <hi>Barcelona,</hi> with this
perſwaſion they ſlacked no time, they made all the haſte they could,
without looſing one dayes journey, and ſo without any let or impediment
befalling them, they came within two leagues of towne, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is nine from
<hi>Barcelona,</hi> named <hi>Yqualada.</hi> They had notice upon the way, how
that a gentleman of quality, who was to go Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour to <hi>Rome,</hi>
ſtayd in <hi>Barcelona</hi> expecting the Collies which were not as yet come
thither; newes w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> liked him well, &amp; gave him much content with this good
tidings they jogged merily on, till they were upon entring into a little wood,
out of which they ſaw a man come running, &amp; look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing behind him, as one
that had bin ſhrewly affrighted. <hi>Don Rafael</hi> put himſelfe before
him, ſaying unto him, my honeſt friend, why doſt thou fly away ſo
faſt? or what is it hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen thee, that with manifeſtation of ſuch
great feare, hath put wings to thy feete, and made thee make ſo much haſt;
will you not that I runne with haſte (anſwered this affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted man)
ſince that I have miraculouſly eſcaped from a company of out-lawes, and
high-way robbers, that keepe this wood to pray upon paſſengers? This is not
well (ſayd the <hi>Muletere</hi>) it is not well I tell you; robbers at this 
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58406:13"/>time of day? wee are like to ſmart for it, they will make
novices of us. Brother be not diſmayd, doe not vex or grieve your ſelfe at
it, for they have done their buſineſſe; and are gone by this time, having
left bound to the Trees of this wood above 30. paſſengers, ſtripping them
even to their very ſhirts. Onely they left one man at libertie, that he might
unbind the reſt, after that they had recovered a little mountaine, from
whence they would give him a ſignall to ſet them free. If this be ſo
(ſayd <hi>Calvete</hi>) for ſo was the <hi>Muletere</hi> called, wee may
ſafely paſſe, becauſe that place where theſe robbers make their pray,
doe not for a pretty whiles after returne thither againe. And this I am able to
aſſure you of, as one that hath fallen twiſe into their hands, and am
well acquainted with their trickes and faſhions; it is true that hee tells
you, ſayd the man. Which being heard by <hi>Don Rafael,</hi> he reſolved to
paſſe forward, and they had not gone farre, when loe they lighted on
thoſe that were bound, being above 40. perſons, whom hee that they had left
looſe, fell to unbinding of them as faſt as he could; it was a ſtrange
ſpectacle, to ſee ſome ſtarke naked, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers clad with the robbers
tattered rags; ſome weeping to ſee themſelves robd and ſtript of all
that they had, others laughing to ſee the ſtrange formes and faſhions of
their fellowes, and how odly they look't when their feathers were pluckt from
them, and outed of their gay cloathes. This man reckoned up to a farthing what
they had taken from him; that other, that a Box with an <hi>Agnus Dei</hi> in
it, which he brought from <hi>Rome</hi> did more grieve and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him then
all the reſt of the things, though of great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lew, which they tooke from
him. In concluſion, all that paſſed there were nothing elſe but teares,
and the loud lamentations of thoſe miſerable diſpoyled paſſengers.
All which not without a great deale of ſorrow, the two bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers beheld,
rendring thankes to heaven that it had freed them from ſo great and imminent
a danger. But that which hath wrought more upon their compaſſion, and 
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58406:14"/>ſtirred up moſt pitty in them, eſpecially in
<hi>Theodoro,</hi> was to ſee faſt bound to the trunke of an oake, a young
youth of the age (to ſeeming) of 16. yeares, with a ſhirt onely to his
backe, and a paire of linnen breeches, but of ſo faire and beautifull a
countenance, that he moved and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced all that beheld him to take pitty of
him. <hi>Theodoro</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted to unbinde him, and he returned very courteous
and thankefull language for the received benefit. And to make it the greater,
he intreated <hi>Calvete</hi> their <hi>Mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tere</hi> to lend him his cloake, till that they
ſhould (which they would do the firſt towne they came at) buy another for
this pretty gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile youth. <hi>Calvete</hi> gave it him, and <hi>Theodoro</hi>
covered there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the youth, asking him whence he was, whence hee came and
whither he would. At all this <hi>Don Rafael</hi> was preſent, and the youth
anſwered, that hee was of <hi>Andalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zia,</hi> and of ſuch a place, which
in naming of it, made them to know it was but two leagues diſtant from their
owne habitation; hee told them that hee came from <hi>Sevill,</hi> and that his
deſigne was to goe for <hi>Italy,</hi> to try his fortune in the exerciſe
of Armes, and to be trayned up in the ſchoole of honour, as many other
<hi>Spaniards</hi> daily uſed to doe. But that his chance was unfortunate by
that his ill incounter, with thoſe Out-lawes and Robbes, who tooke a good
quantity of money from him and ſuch cloathes that hee could not buy the like
for 300. Crownes, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, he was reſolved to
proſecute his courſe becauſe hee came of ſuch a race, that the firſt
evill ſucceſſe that befell him, ſhould not coole the heate of his
fervent deſire. The good diſcourſe and language of the youth, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with their having heard that hee was ſo neare a neighbour unto them, and more
eſpecially for that Letter of recommendation which was writ in his forehead,
wrought a loving affection in both the brothers to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour him in all they were
able. And ſo ſharing amongſt thoſe which to their ſeeming had moſt
need, ſome monies; more particularly amongſt the Fryers and Churchmen,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58406:14"/>which were to the number of eight. They made the youth to
get up upon <hi>Calvetes</hi> Mule, and without further ſtay, in ſhort
ſpace they arrived at <hi>Yqualada,</hi> where they came to learne that the
Galleyes had put into <hi>Barcelona</hi> the day before, and that within
thoſe two dayes they were to be gone, if foule weather did not hinder them.
This newes made them to riſe early in the morning before the Sunne was up,
though all that night they ſlept but broken ſleepe; The occaſion of this
ſuddaine paſſion and inquietude in the two brothers, grew upon this
occaſion; they ſitting at board, and with the youth whom they had unbound,
<hi>Theodoro</hi> fixed his eyes very wiſhly on his face, and behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
ſomewhat curiouſly with a prying looke, hee percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that hee had holes
boared through the tippes of his cares, and as well by this, and by that mayden
bluſh, and modeſt countenance which hee ſhowed, his minde gave him that
ſhee muſt needes bee a woman and ſate upon thornes all ſupper time,
wiſhing that it were ended, that taking him aſide he might the better
certifie himſelfe of this his ſuſpition And whilſt they were at
ſupper, <hi>Don Rafael</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him whoſe ſonne hee was,
becauſe hee knew all the principall perſons thereabouts, and if he had
named the place aright, he could not chuſe but know his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and
qualitie. Whereunto the youth anſwered, that he was the ſonne of <hi>Don
Henrique de Cardenas,</hi> a Gentleman well knowne to all, hereunto <hi>Don
Rafael</hi> replyed, that hee very well knew <hi>Don Henrique de Cardenas,</hi>
but withall knew and was well aſſured of it, that he had no ſonne at all,
but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that he told him ſo, becauſe hee was loath to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
his parents; and becauſe it did not import him to know whether it were ſo
or no, he would not preſſe that point any further, nor had any purpoſe to
queſtion him any more of it, it is true (anſwered the youth) that <hi>Don
Henrique</hi> hath no ſonnes, but a brother of his called, <hi>Don
Sancho.</hi> Nay (quoth <hi>Don Rafael</hi>) that is not ſo, he hath no
ſonnes neither, but one onely daughter, and it is ſayd of her, that ſhee
is the<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58406:15"/>faireſt Damſell that is in all
<hi>Andaluzia;</hi> but this I know no otherwiſe then by the fames and
generall report that goes of her. For though I have beene often there where
ſhee lives, yet it was never my good happe to ſee her. All that you ſay
(Sir) is true, (replyed the youth) for <hi>Don Sancho</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede hath no
more but one daughter, but not ſo fayre as fame reports her. And if I told
you that I was ſonne to <hi>Don Henrique,</hi> I ſpoke it (Gentlemen) onely
to this end, that you might holde me in the better eſteeme, but ingeniouſly
to confeſſe the truth, I am not the ſonne of <hi>Don Henrique,</hi> but
of the Steward to <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> who hath ſerved him theſe many
yeares, and I was borne in his houſe, and upon a certaine diſtaſte which
I had given my father, having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken good ſtore of money with mee, I was
willing as I told you to make for <hi>Italy,</hi> and to follow the wars, by
which courſe I have ſeene many of meane birth and obſcure pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents come
to be noble, and riſe to the higheſt places of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and command. All
theſe reaſons, and the manner of delivering them. <hi>Theodoro</hi>
attentively noted, and ſtill went more and more confirming the ſuſpition
hee had entertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Now by this time ſupper was ended, and all taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and while <hi>Don Rafael</hi> was making himſelfe unready, <hi>Theodore</hi>
having told him the conceived ſuſpition he had of the youth, with his good
leave and liking he tooke the youth aſide to a broad bay window, which looked
out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſtreete, and they two ſtanding both cloſe breſt to
breſt, <hi>Theodoro</hi> began to breake the Ice, and to ſpeake to the
youth in this inſuing manner.</p>
            <p>I could wiſh <hi>(Sennor Franciſco)</hi> for ſo did he
ſtile himſelfe) that it had beene in my power to have done you ſo many
good offices, that they might have obliged you, not to deny me any thing
whatſoever, that I eyther could or would aske of you, but that little time
which hath brought you to my knowledge hath not given way thereunto, it may be
that in that which is to come, you ſhall come to know that which my deſire
deſerveth from you. And if<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58406:15"/>to that which I now have at
this proſent, you ſhall not be pleaſed to give ſatisfaction; yet for
all this ſhall I not ceaſe to be your ſervant, as I now profes my ſelf
truly to be. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that I diſcover my conception unto you, I would have
you to know, that although my yeares be as few as yours, yet have I had more
experience of the things of this world, then they promiſe. And thereby have I
come to ſuſpect, that you are not a man as your habit ſhowes you to be,
but a woman, and likewiſe ſo borne as your beauty publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth you to bee,
and peradventure ſo unfortunate as this changing of your apparell preſents
it to our underſtanding, ſince that ſuch kinde of diſguizing as theſe
are never good for the party that put them on; if that which I ſuſpect be
true, deale plainely with mee, for I ſweare and vow unto you by the faith of
a gentleman, that I will aſſiſt and ſerve you in all that I am able.
Now, that you are not a woman, you cannot poſſibly deny it, for by thoſe
windowes in your eares, the truth is clearely to bee ſeene, and I muſt tell
you, you have beene a little too negligent and careleſſe in the ſhutting
and ſtopping of theſe holes, with ſome wax of the ſame colour with your
eare, which might ſo artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally have beene done, that another ſo curious
as my ſelfe though not ſo honeſt, ſhould hardly have diſcerned that
which you have not ſo well knowne to cover. I tell you therefore that you
neede not bee ſcrupulous, or caſte any doubts in declaring unto me who you
are, for I offer you my aſſiſtance and ſervice, and aſſure you that
I will bee as ſecret as you your ſelfe would have me to be.</p>
            <p>With great attention did this youth ſtand, hearkning to that
which <hi>Theodoro</hi> ſayd unto him; and continuing a while ſilent before
that ſhe made him any anſwer, ſhe tooke hold on both his hands, and
bringing them up to his mouth, by playne force hee kiſt them, and likewiſe
bathed them with great ſtore of teares, which trickled downe his faire eyes,
which ſtrange ſorrow cauſed the like in <hi>Theodoro,</hi> in ſo much
that ſhee could not forheare to accompany him in<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58406:16"/>them, it
being the proper and naturall condition of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of qualitie to grow tender
and ſenſible of other folkes griefes and afflictions. But after that with
ſome difficultie he had with drawne her hand from the youths mouth, hee
ſtood very attentive to ſee what anſwer hee would give him; who ſending
forth a grievous groane, accompanied with many ſighes ſayd, Sir, I neither
will, nor can deny that your ſuſpition hath not beene true, I am a woman,
and of all women the moſt unfortunate, that ever was brought forth into the
world. And ſince that the good deeds which you have done me, and the faire
offers which you have made me, oblige me to obey you in all that you ſhall
command me; liſten now unto mee, for I ſhall now tell you who I am, if it
may not be trouble ſome and tedious unto you, to heare anothers misfortunes.
Let me live for ever in them, (replyed <hi>Theodoro</hi>) if I ſhall not take
as great pleaſure in knowing them, as I ſhall the paine they will give mee,
in that they are yours. For I already begin to bee a ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of them as
if they were mine owne. And ſo returning to imbrace him, and to make him new
and true offers, the youth being ſomewhat better quieted, began to ſpeake
in this wiſe.</p>
            <p>Touching my countrey I told you the truth, but touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my
parents, not. For <hi>Don Henrique</hi> is not my father, but mine uncle, but
his brother <hi>Don Sancho</hi> is. And I am that unfortunate daughter which
<hi>Don Sancho</hi> hath; who for her beauty (as your brother ſaith) is ſo
much prayſed and commended, the falſehood whereof is eaſily to be ſeene
in that little or none at all that I have. My name is <hi>Leocadia;</hi> the
occaſion of changing my attire. I ſhall now deliver unto you. Two leagues
from that place where I liv'd, there is another, one of the richeſt
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> nobleſt in all
<hi>Andaluzia,</hi> where in there liveth a principall gentleman, who fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his pedegree from the noble and ancient <hi>Adorno's of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa.</hi> This
gentleman hath a ſonne, who (if fame doe not overlaſh herſelfe in his
prayſes, (as ſhee hath done in mine)<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58406:16"/>is in the ranke of
thoſe Gentlemen, which diſerve no mean commendation, being every way as
compleate as can bee wiſhed or deſired in one of his qualitie. This
Gentleman then, as well for the vicinitie of both theſe places, as alſo
that hee was well affectioned to the exerciſe and ſport of hunting, as my
father likewiſe was, came now and then to our houſe, and ſtayd there five
or ſix dayes together. All which dayes, yea and even part alſo of the
nights hee and my father paſſed abroad in the fields. From this occaſion
eyther Fortune or Love or my little heedfulneſſe, took that which was
ſufficient to throw me downe headlong from the height of my good thoughts, to
the bottome of that low eſtate and condition wherein I now am. For having
behelde ſome what more then was lawfull for a wary and diſcreete Damſell,
the gentileneſſe and diſcretion of <hi>Marco Antonio,</hi> and having
conſidered the qualitie of his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, and the great ſtore of goods,
(bearing the name of thoſe of Fortune) which his father had, it ſeemed unto
me, that if I could get him to be my husband, it was all the happineſſe
that could come within the compaſſe of my deſire. With this thought I
began to eye him with more eare, when as indeede it ought to have bin done with
more careleſneſſe, ſince that he thereby came to take notice of my love
by my lookes. Nor did this Traytour eyther deſire or neede any other entrance
for to enter himſelfe into the ſecret of my boſome, and to robbe me of
the beſt pledges of my ſoule. But I know not (Sir) to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I
ſhould put my ſelfe to recount unto you point by point thoſe leſſer
matters in the proſecution of our love, becauſe they make little to the
ſubſtance of that buſineſſe I am to treate of, but to tell you at
once that, which he with ſo many ſolicitations obtayned of me, which was
that having given mee his faith and word, under great and (to my ſeeming
firme and Chriſtian oaths) to be my husband, I offered my ſelfe unto him to
doe whatſoever he would with me. But yet for all this, being not well
ſatisfied with <pb n="26" facs="tcp:58406:17"/>his oathes, and words, to the end that the
winde might not carry them away, I wrought with him, that hee ſhould write
them downe in a Schedule firmed with his name, ſtrengthned with ſo many
circumſtances, that therewith I reſted ſatisfied. Having received this
Schedule &amp; note under his hand, I plotted and diviſed how that on ſuch
a night, he ſhould come from his owne houſe to mine, and enter by clambring
over the garden wall, into my lodging, where without any diſturbance he might
reape that friuit, which for him onely was reſerved and deſtinated, at
laſt came that night which by me was ſo much deſired.</p>
            <p>Till ſhe came to this point, <hi>Theodoro</hi> had the patience
to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſilent, having her ſoule hanging on the words of
<hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadia,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> with every one of them as with ſo many ſwords did
paſſe through her very ſoule; eſpecially, when ſhe heard the name of
<hi>Marco Antonio,</hi> &amp; ſaw the rare beauty of <hi>Leocadia,</hi> and
conſidered the greatneſſe of her worth, interwoven with that her
ſingular diſcretion, which ſhe had well ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtd in the manner of
recounting this her ſtory. But when ſhe came to ſay; at laſt came that
night which by me was ſo much deſired, ſhe was ready to looſe the
ſtirrops of her patience, and not being able to hold and containe herſelf
any longer, ſhee brake out interrupting her diſcourſe, into theſe
enſuing words. Very well; and when this moſt happy and deſired night was
come, what did he then? Had hee the good happe to enter? Did he injoy you? did
he anew con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the <hi>Schedula?</hi> Did he reſt well pleaſed in having
gotten that of you w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> you ſay was only his? did your father know of it? or
in what ended theſe honeſt and wiſe beginnings.</p>
            <p>They did end (replyed <hi>Leocadia</hi>) in putting me into this
caſe wherein you now ſee me; for I did neither enjoy him, nor he me, nor
came to any certaine concluſion and finall agreement.</p>
            <p>With theſe words <hi>Theodoſia</hi> began to recover a little
breath, and gathered up againe thoſe her ſpirits unto her, which by little
and little went leaving her vicall parts, incited and<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58406:17"/>egged
on by that raging peſtilence of jealouſie, which ſpreading and defuſing
it ſelfe, went entring her very bones and marrow, for to take intire
poſſeſſion of her patience. But for all this did not free her ſo
fully therefro, but that with ſome qualmes and heart-paſſions, ſhee
returned to hearken againe unto that which <hi>Leocadia</hi> proſecuted,
ſaying; he did not onely not come unto me, but ſome eight dayes after I was
certainly informed that hee had abſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelfe from his owne home, and
carryed away with him, ſtealing her out of her fathers houſe, a Damſell
of the ſame place where hee lived, the daughter of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Gentleman, named
<hi>Theodoſia,</hi> a Damſell of extraordinary beautie, and rare
diſcretion. And for that ſhee was deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of ſuch noble Parents,
this ſtealth was ſpead abroad in our Towne, and preſently brought to my
eares, and with it that colde and fearefull Lance of jealouſie which pierced
my heart, and did ſet my ſoule on ſuch a flaming fire, that thereby my
honour was turned into aſhes, my credit conſumed, my patience parched, and
my wiſedome waſted to nothing. Ah me, moſt unfortunae! for I then
preſently began to figure in my imagination <hi>Theodoſia</hi> to be fayrer
then the Sunne, and more diſcreete then diſcretion it ſelfe, and above
all, farre more happy then I miſerable. I reade over and over the words of
the Schedule againe and againe, I looked on the ſigning and confirming of our
ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage by aſſurance, having ſet downe his name thereunto in writing
with his owne hand, and that they could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly fayle in that faith
which they publiſhed: and although unto them, as to a Sanctuary, my hopes
fled for ſhelter. but when I fell into the reckoning of that juſtly to bee

hopes fell to the ground. I did ill intreate my face, I did teare my hayres and
curſed my misfortune And that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> did moſt of all grieve me was that I
could not offer up theſe ſacrifices by reaſon of the inforced preſence
of my father. In concluſion that I might make<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58406:18"/>an end of my
wayling, and mourne to the full without any let or hinderance to ſtop the
current of my ſorrows, I reſolved with my ſelfe to leave my fathers
houſe; and for to put in execution an evill thought, it ſeemeth that
opportunity is never wanting, and that occaſion doth fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate, and remove
out of the way all inconveniences, without fearing any thing that might befall
mee, I ſtole from one of my fathers Pages a ſuite of cloathes, and from my
father good ſtore of coyne; and in a night that had put on his blacke cloake,
I left the houſe, and walked ſome League a foote, till I came to a Towne
called <hi>Oſuna.</hi> And accommodating my ſelf there with a Wagon, from
thence, within two dayes after I arrived in <hi>Sevill,</hi> which was an
entring into the ſecureſt place that poſſibly could be for not being
found out, though they ſhould ſeeke after mee. There I bought me other
cloathes, and a Mule, and with certaine Gentlemen that were ſpeedily to goe
to <hi>Barcelona,</hi> that they might not looſe the opportunitie of the
Galleyes, which were to goe for <hi>Italy,</hi> I travailed till yeſterday a
long with them, when that befell mee which you know already, falling into the
hand of Out lawes, and Robbers, who tooke all that I had from mee, and
amongſt other things, that le well which did keepe me alive, preforve my

if he hath taken her along with him, and they who love each other ſo well,
living together, what deceit can there bee in this? Certainely none at all;
they live contented ſince they live together. But I could wiſh (as wee

your jealouſie hath miſguided you, and blinded the eyes of your

<hi>Leocadia</hi> thanked <hi>Theodoſia,</hi> whom ſhee tooke to be
<hi>Theodoro,</hi> and moſt kindly accepted of theſe her many courteous
offers, and gave her leave to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint her brother with what ſhe thought
fit, beſeeching her, that ſhe would take her into her protection, ſince
that ſhee ſaw to what dangers ſhee was expoſed if ſhee ſhould be
knowne to be a woman. With this they tooke leave each of other and repayred to
their ſeverall lodgings to take their reſt. <hi>Theodoſia</hi> to that of
her brother, and <hi>leoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> to another that adjoyned thereunto. <hi>Don
Rafael</hi> was not as yet fallen aſleepe, expecting the comming of his
ſiſter, that hee might know what paſſed with him, whom ſhee thought
to be a woman. And ſhee entring before that he had ſetled himſelfe to
take his reſt, hee demanded of her whether it were ſo or no? Who point by
point, recounted all that <hi>Leocadia</hi> had ſayd unto her. As, whoſe
daughter ſhe was, her being in love, the Schedule of <hi>Marco Antonio,</hi>
and her intended purpoſe. <hi>Don Rafael</hi> wondred at it, and ſayd unto
his ſiſter, if ſhee be the ſame ſhee ſpeaketh herſelfe to be, I
muſt tell you (ſiſter) ſhee is of that place wherein ſhe lives the
moſt principall, and one of the nobleſt gentle women in all
<hi>Andaluzia.</hi> Her father is very well knowne to ours, and that report
which hath gone of her beauty, doth anſwer very well unto that which wee now
ſee in her countenance, and my opinion in this particular is; that we muſt
be very wary and circumſpect, that ſhe doe not get the ſtarte of us, and
ſpeake firſt with <hi>Marco Antonio.</hi> For that Schedule which ſhe
ſaith he made, though we ſhould ſuppoſe it to be loſt, yet will it
behoove us to looke about us, and will (I feare me) coſt us ſome eare. But
be of good cheere (ſiſter) get you to bed and take your reſt, for wee
ſhall ſeeke out a remedy to prevent this miſchiefe, and to meete with all
inconverſiences that ſhall occurre. <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi> did that which
her brother commanded her concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58406:20"/>her going to bed, but
in that of taking her leſt, that lay not in her hand to doe it; for that
raging plague of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie had taken poſſeſſion of her ſoule. O
how much greater then it was in it ſelfe repreſented it ſelfe unto her
imagination, the beautie of <hi>Leocadia,</hi> and the diſloyaltie of
<hi>Marco Antonio!</hi> Oh! how often did ſhee reade, or feigned to reade the
Schedule which he had given her! Oh! what reaſons and words did ſhee adde
thereunto to make it the more effectuall and authenticall! How often would
ſhee not beleeve that ſhee had loſt it. And how often imagine that
without it, <hi>Marco Antonio</hi> would not faile to comply with his
promiſe, without ſo much as once thinking on that, which hee had made unto
her, and the obligation wherein he ſtood bound unto her! In theſe and the
like paſſages paſſed the greater part of that night, without
ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one winke. And as little reſt tooke her brother <hi>Don
Rafael.</hi> For as ſoone as hee heard tell who <hi>Leocadia</hi> was, his
heart was as hotly inflamed with love as if he had long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the ſame
end held communication and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with her. For ſuch force hath
beauty that in an inſtant, in a moment of time it carries after it the
deſire of him that beholds &amp; knowes it, &amp; when he doth diſcover or
promiſe to himſelfe ſome meanes how to obtaine and injoy it, the ſoule
of him that contemplates it, is ſet on fire with a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull vehemencie,
juſt after the ſame manner and eaſineſſe as dry and well conditioned
powder quickly takes fire with the leaſt ſparke that toucheth it. Hee did
now no more imagine her to be tyed and bound to a tree, nor clad with the
tattred cloathes of a man, but in her womans ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, and in the houſe of
her rich parents, and of that principall ranke and qualitie as they were. He
did not nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was willing to detaine his thoughts in a cauſe of that
conſequence, as this of bringing her to his knowledge, and therefore
deſired that day were come that he might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute his journey, and finde
out <hi>Marco Antonio,</hi> not ſo much for to make him his brother in law,
as for to divert him<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58406:20"/>from marrying of <hi>Leocadia.</hi> And
now love and jealouſie had taken ſuch ſtrong hold on him, that hee would
have held it for a good opinion rather to ſee his ſiſter without that
remedy, which hee promiſed to procure for her, and <hi>Marco Antonio</hi>
without life, and fairely buried, then to ſee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hopeleſſe of
obtayning <hi>Leocadia.</hi> Which hopes went on, promiſing him a happy
ſucceſſe in his deſire, either by the way of force or by faire meanes,
ſince that for the effecting of his purpoſe, time and occaſion offered
themſelves for ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: With this which he promiſed to himſelf, he was
ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what quieted, and within a little while after the day began to appeare;
and then they began to leave their beds. And <hi>Don Rafael</hi> calling for
the hoſte of the houſe, demanded of him whether that their towne would
afford a ſuit of cloaths for a Page who had bin ſtipt naked by out-lawes
and robbers? Mine hoſte replyed, that he himſelfe had a reaſonable
hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſuite to ſell. He brought it, and it fitted <hi>Leocadia</hi>
as well as if it had beene made for her. <hi>Don Rafael</hi> payd him for it,
and ſhee did put it on, and girded her ſword and dagger un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her with
ſuch a grace and ſpirit, that in that very garbe &amp; habit of hers,
ſhee did ſuſpend the ſenſes of <hi>Don Rafael,</hi> and multiply
jealouſies in <hi>Theodoſia. Calvete</hi> had ſadled his Mules and about
eight in the morning they departed from their Inne, and ſet onward on their
journey for <hi>Barcelona,</hi> omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for the preſent to viſit the
famous Monaſtery of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerrat;</hi> I want words to expreſſe to
the life the thoughts which the two brothers entertained and with what
diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent mindes both of them went looking on <hi>Leocadia; Theodoſia</hi>
deſiring her death, and <hi>Don Rafael,</hi> her life, both of them being
jealous and paſſionate. <hi>Theodoſia</hi> ſeeking to finde out ſome
faults in her that ſhee might not deſpaire of her hopes; And <hi>Don
Rafael</hi> finding out perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in her, that did the more obliege him to
love her; yet for all this they were not careleſſe in making all the haſt
they could, ſo that they came to <hi>Barcelona</hi> before Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet. They
did wonder at the beautifull ſituation of that<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58406:21"/>Citic, and
held it to bee the flower of the fayreſt Cities of the world, the honour of
<hi>Spaine,</hi> the terrour of their bordering and remote enemies, the
pleaſure and delight of its inhabitants, the Protectreſſe of ſtrangers,
the ſchoole of Chevalty, the patterne of loyaltie, and the ſatisfaction of
all that which a diſcreete and curious deſire can expect or wiſh from a
great, famous, ritch and well founded Citie. In their entring thereinto they
heard an exceeding great noyſe and clamour, and they might ſee a great
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of people runne in a tumultuous kinde of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and asking the
cauſe of that noyſe and hurrey, they made them anſwer, that they of the
Gallies that were at the ſea ſide, were together by the eares with thoſe
of the Citie. Which <hi>Don Rafael</hi> hearing, would needs goe ſee what
paſſed amongſt them, though <hi>Calvete</hi> told him that hee ſhould
by no meanes doe it; for there was no wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or diſcretion in ſo
doing, and that thereby hee would put himſelfe into manifeſt perill, for
hee knew well enough by experience how ill they came off, who did thruſt
themſelves into ſuch kinde of differences, and confuſed garboyles, which
were ordinary in that Citie, when the Gallies came thither: but this good
counſell of <hi>Calvete</hi> could not prevaile ſo farre forth with <hi>Don
Rafael</hi> as to hinder his going, and ſo they all followed him. And in
comming to the Sea ſheare they might ſee many ſwords drawne, and many
people flaſhing each other without any pitty or mercy. Notwithſtanding all
this, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out alighting they came ſo neare unto them, that they might
diſtinctly ſee the faces of thoſe that fought, for the Sun was not as yet
downe Infinite was the people which came from the Citie, and great likewiſe
the number which disim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked themſelves from the gallies, howbeithe that had
the charge of the gallies, who was a knight of <hi>Valencia,</hi> called
<hi>Don Pedro Vique,</hi> from the Poope of the Captain galley threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
thoſe who had imbarked themſelves in the Cockboate to go &amp; relieve
their fellows; but ſeeing his pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſwaſions nor<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58406:21"/>threatnings could prevayle with
them, hee cauſed the prowe of the Gallies to be turned towards the Citie, and
a peece of Ordnance to be diſcharged without a bullet, being a ſignall unto
them, that if they did not depart and get them gone the next ſhould not be
ſhot off without it. <hi>Don Rafael</hi> was very attentive in beholding this
cruell brangling and ſcuffling amongſt them, and had noted and obſerved
that amongſt other brave fellowes that tooke part with the Gallies, there was
a young man that layd about him luſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, being about the age of two and
twenty, little more or leſſe, clad in greene, with a hat of the ſame
colour, adorned with a rich Hatband of Diamonds, the nimbleneſſe and
dextrouſneſſe wherewith this young gallant fought, and the bravery of his
cloathes cauſed all thoſe that beheld the fight to turne their eyes towards
him, and in ſuch ſteadfaſt manner thoſe of <hi>Theodoſia,</hi> and
<hi>Leocadia,</hi> that both of them at one and the ſame inſtant cryed out,
God bleſſe me, eyther I have no eyes, or he in the greene is <hi>Marco
Antonio.</hi> And no ſooner had they ſayd this, but with great
nimbleneſſe they diſmounted from their Mules, and drawing out their
ſwords and daggers without any feare in the world, they made way through the
midſt of all the company, and placed themſelves one on the one ſide, and
the other on the other of <hi>Marco Antonio,</hi> (for he was that young man in
greene wee formerly ſpoke of.) Feare you nothing, <hi>Marco Antonio,</hi>
(ſo ſayd <hi>Leocadia,</hi> as ſoone as ſhee came in unto him) for you
have one at your ſide, who with the loſſe of his owne life, will be a
ſhield for to ſave yours, who doubts it (replyed <hi>Theodoſia</hi>) I
being here? <hi>Don Rafael,</hi> who ſaw and heard, what had paſſed, hee
likewiſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and tooke part with him. <hi>Marco Antonio</hi>
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing buſied in offending others, and defending him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, did not take
any notice of thoſe words theſe two then ſayd, but rather being very hot
and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt in fight, did things (to ſeeming) beyond be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe. But in
regard that the multitude of people <pb n="36" facs="tcp:58406:22"/>came continually
flocking from the Citie, they of the Galleyes were enforced to retreate, wading
through the water to get into their Boates; <hi>Marco Antonio</hi> retired
like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe though ſore againſt his will; And (ſayling by the ſame
compaſſe) went retiring on eyther ſide of him thoſe two valiant and new
<hi>Bradamante,</hi> and <hi>Marfiſa,</hi> or <hi>Hippolita</hi> and
<hi>Pentheſilea.</hi> Now while they were in this hurly burly came thither a
Knight of <hi>Catalunia,</hi> of the famous family of the <hi>Cardonas</hi>
upon a ſtrong ſturdy ſteede, and putting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the midſt of
eyther partie, he made thoſe of the City to retire; ſuch was the reſpect,
which they bare unto him. But ſome that were further off threw ſtones at
thoſe which were making to the water, &amp; as ill luck would have it, one
hit <hi>Marco Antonio</hi> full on the boſome, with ſuch force &amp; fury,
that he fell therewith in the water being already up therein to the knees. But
<hi>Leocadia</hi> had ſcarce ſeene him fall, but ſhe preſently tooke
hold of him and upheld him in her armes, and the like did <hi>Theodoſia. Don
Rafael</hi> was a little further off from them, defending him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>elfe from thoſe ſhowers of ſtones,
which rayned downe about his eares. And being deſirous to approach to his
ſoules remedy, and to haſten to the helping and relieving of his ſiſter
and brother in Law, this <hi>Catalunian</hi> Knight puts himſelfe before him,
and ſayd unto him; Sir, I command you to bee quiet by that duty which you owe
to the profeſſion of a good ſouldier, and doe me the favour to goe along
with me by my ſide, and I will free you from the inſolencie and exceſſe
of this unruly route. Good Sir (anſwered <hi>Don Rafael</hi>) I beſeech you
ſuffer mee to paſſe on, for I ſee thoſe things in great danger, which
in this life I love moſt. The Knight per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him to paſſe, but he came
ſomewhat to late, for the boate belonging to the Captaine Gally had before
hee came taken in <hi>Marco Antonio,</hi> and <hi>Leocadia,</hi> who would
never let him goe out of her armes; And <hi>Theodoſia</hi> deſiring to
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barke her ſelfe with them, whether it were that ſhee were weary, or
whether ſhee were overcome with griefe to<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58406:22"/>ſee <hi>Marco
Antonio</hi> wounded, or whether inraged with jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie to ſee her great
enemy to goe along with him, ſhee had neither power nor ſtrength for to get
into the boate, and doubtleſſe had fallen downe in a ſwoune into the
wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter if her brother had not come in time to ſuccour her; who felt no
leſſe paine and torment then his ſiſter had felt, in ſeeing that
<hi>Leocadia</hi> went away with <hi>Marco Antonio</hi> (for he likewiſe had
taken notice of him, and knew him to be <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co Antonio.</hi>) The
<hi>Catalunian</hi> Knight, being much affected and taken with the gentle
preſence of <hi>Don Rafael,</hi> and his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (whom he tooke to be a man)
called unto them from the Sea ſhore, intreating them that they would goe
along with him, and they being inforced by neceſſitie, and being afrayd
leaſt the people, which were not pacified, might doe them ſome wrong, they
were willing to accept of the friendly offer he had made them. The Knight
lighted off from his horſe and taking them by his ſide, he paſſed with
his naked ſword through the midſt of that tumultuous route, intreating them
to retyre and ſo they did. <hi>Don Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fael</hi> looked round about on every
ſide to ſee whether hee could eſpy <hi>Calvete</hi> with their Mules but
could not, for as ſoone as they had alighted hee tooke hold on the Mules, and
driving them before him went unto an Inne, where he had often heretofore
lodged. The Knight came home to his owne houſe, which was one of the
chiefeſt in all the Citie, and demanding of <hi>Don Rafael</hi> in which of
the Gallies he came, made anſwer, in none of them: But that he was newly come
into the Citie in that very inſtant that this difference began, and for that
he knew in that conflict the Gentleman whom they caried away hurt with a
ſtone into the boate, hee had put himſelfe into that perill, and did
therefore earneſtly intreate him that he would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to give order
for the bringing of him on ſhoare that was wounded, for thereon depended both
his content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and life. This ſhall I doe with a very good will (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
the Knight) and I know the that Generall will not<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58406:23"/>deny me
this courteſie, but ſecurely truſt mee with him: for he is a Gentleman of
good ranke and qualitie, and my neare kinſman. And without further delaying
the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, he returned back to the Gally where he found them very
buſie in curing <hi>Marco Antonio,</hi> and the wound hee had received was
very dangerous, becauſe it was on the left ſide neare the heart, and for
that the Chirurgion ſayd it was dangerous, he prevayled ſo farre forth with
the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,</hi> that he gave him leave to take him along with him to
cure him on land, and ſo putting him with great eare and tenderneſſe into
the boate, they brought him thence, <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadia</hi> as one that was loath to
leave him, imbarking her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with him, and following him, as the
North-ſtarre of her hope. Being now landed on the ſhoare, the Knight
cauſed a hand-chaire to be brought from his houſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to carry him
with the more eaſe. In the interim whilſt this was in doing, <hi>Don
Rafael</hi> had ſent to ſeeke out <hi>Calvete</hi> who was ſafe in his
Inne, though very ſad, and with a great deale of eare, to know what was
become of his Maſters, and when he knew that they were well, he was exceeding
glad, and came thither where <hi>Don Rafael</hi> was. Anon after came the
Maſter of the houſe, <hi>Marco Antonio,</hi> and <hi>Leocadia,</hi> who all
lodged therein, and were entertayned with much love, and magnificence. And
there was preſent or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der taken that a very famous Chirurgion of that Citie
ſhould bee ſent for to take anew upon him the curing of <hi>Marco
Antonio,</hi> He came, but would not meddle with him, till the day following,
ſaying, That the Chirurgions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Armies and Fleets, were evermore
well expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced men, by reaſon of the many hurt and wounded perſons,
which every foot they had under their hands, and therefore held it not
convenient to enter upon the cure till the next day. That which hee gave
preſent order for was; that they ſhould place him in a very warme lodging
where they ſhould let him take his reſt. At that very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant came
thither the Chirurgion of the gally, and gave an<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58406:23"/>account to
that other of the Citie of the nature and quality of the hurt, and what he
applyed for the curing of it, and in what danger (to his ſeeming) his life
was in, with which information he reſted fully ſatisfied of that which hee
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to know. And he himſelfe (according to that relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which hee
had received) did exaggerate the danger wherein <hi>Marco Antonio</hi> was
<hi>Leocadia</hi> and <hi>Theodoſia</hi> heard this, with that griefe and
ſorrow of heart: as if they had heard the ſentence of their owne deaths,
but that they might not make ſhow thereof, they did repreſſe and
ſilence it all they could for that time, yet had <hi>Leocadia</hi> reſolved
with her ſelfe to doe that, which ſhee thought fitting for the
ſatisfaction of her honour. And this it was, as ſcone as ever the
Chirurgions were gone, ſhee comes me into <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co Antonio's</hi> lodging,
and before the Maſter of the houſe <hi>Dond Rafael, Theodoſia</hi> and
divers other perſons ſhee made up to the beds head of this wounded
gentleman, and taking him faſt by the hand, ſhee ſpake thus unto him, It
is now no fit time <hi>(Senior Marco Antonio Adorno)</hi> being in that ſtate
wherein you now are, to ſpend many words with you, and therefore I ſhall
onely intreate you that you will lend your eare to thoſe few which convene,
if not to the health of your bodie, yet to that of your ſoule. And that I may
ſpeake them the more freely, it is needefull that you give me your good
leave, and licence, and that you will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what I ſhall ſay unto you
if you have a minde to heare mee. For it ſhould bee contrary to all reaſon,
that I having indeavoured from the very inſtant that I knew you, not to give
you any diſtaſte, but did all to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and liking, that now at this
preſent, for my laſt fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, I ſhould bee the cauſe of giving you
any the leaſt griefe or ſorrow. At theſe words <hi>Marco Antonio</hi>
opened his eyes and ſteadily fixed them on <hi>Leocadias</hi> face, and
having recollected himſelfe, and taken her in a manner into his knowledge
more by the Organe of her voyce then by her countenance, with a weake and
feeble voyce, as one that<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58406:24"/>was full of paine, hee ſayd unto
her, ſay on Sir what you pleaſe for I am not yet ſo neare my end, that I
cannot liſten unto you, neither is this voyce of yours ſo harſh and
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing unto me, that it ſhould cauſe any faſtidiouſneſſe or
loathing in me to heare it.</p>
            <p>To all this Dialogue <hi>Theodoſia</hi> was moſt attentive,
and every word that <hi>Leocadia</hi> uttered was a ſharpe Arrow that went
athwart her heart, and wounded likewiſe the very ſoule of <hi>Don
Rafael,</hi> who alſo heard her. And <hi>Leocadia</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting what
ſhee had begunne, went on thus; if ſome blow on your head, or to ſpeake
more properly, if one greater hath not lighted on my ſoule, it could not
<hi>(Semor Marco Antonio)</hi> beate out of your memory, the image of her, who
not long ſince, you were wont to ſay was your glory, and your Heaven, you
may very well call to your remembrance, who <hi>Leocadia</hi> was, and what was
the word that you gave her ſigned in a Schedule with your owne hand, nor can
you bee forgetfull of the worth of her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, the integritie of her
retyredneſſe and honeſtie, and of the obligation wherein you ſtand
bound unto her, for having applyed her ſelfe to your guſt and liking in all
whatſoever you deſired. If you have not forgotten this, howbeit you ſee
me in this ſo different a habit, you may eaſily know that I am
<hi>Leocadia,</hi> who being fearefull leaſt new accidents and new
occaſions ſhould quit me of that which is ſo juſtly mine, as ſoone as
I knew that you were gone out of the countrey, treading under foote and
ſleighting all whatſoever (though never ſo infinite inconveniences,) I
reſolved with my ſelfe to follow after you in this habit, with intention to
ſeeke you out in all parts of the earth, till I had found you out, whereat
you ought not to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, if your ſelfe hath at any time felt the force of
true Love, and the rage of a deceived woman. Some troubles I have paſſed in
this my demande, all which I account well beſtowed with that diſcount which
they have brought with them, in making me ſo happy as to ſee you. 
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58406:24"/>And conſidering the caſe wherein you are, if that it
ſhall pleaſe God to take you from this to a better life, by your doing that
which you ought (as worthie your ſelfe) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your departure out of this
life, I ſhall thinke my ſelfe the happieſt woman in the world:
promiſing you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take my ſelfe to ſuch a courſe of life after your
death, that but little time ſhall be ſpent therein, before I follow you in
this your laſt and inforced journey. And therefore firſt of all I beſeech
you for the love you beare unto God, to whom my deſires and intentions goe
directed; next, for your owne ſake, who oweth much to your qualitie, and
therefore ought to bee the ſame you are. And laſtly, for my ſake, to whom
you owe more then to any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the world, that now preſently you
will receive me for your lawfull ſpouſe, not permitting that juſtice
ſhould inforce you to that, which with ſuch and ſo many reall
obligations, reaſon ought to perſwade you unto. And here <hi>Leocadia</hi>
ſtopt the current of her ſpeach, and ſayd not a word more; and all they
that were in the roome were in a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfell ſtill ſilence all the while
that ſhee talked with him, and with the ſame ſtilneſſe and ſilenee
they expected what anſwer <hi>Marco Antonio</hi> would make her, which was
this.</p>
            <p>I cannot <hi>(Leocadia)</hi> deny my knowing of you, for your
voyce and countenance will not give me leave ſo to doe. Neither can I deny
how much I am bound unto you, nor the great worth of your noble parents,
togeather with your owne incomparable honeſtie, and retiredneſſe, neither
doe I nor will I eſteeme you in leſſe for that which you have done, in
comming to ſeeke me out in a habit ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from your owne, but for
this I do &amp; ſhall ever eſteeme of you in the higheſt degree that may
be imagined. But ſince that my time (you ſay) is now come, and that I
likewiſe beleeve that this may be the laſt day of my life, and ſince that
ſuch kinde of trances as theſe are the Chryſolls of truth, purifying the
Gold from the droſſe, truth from falſehood; I will tell you a truth,
which if it ſhall not<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58406:25"/>bee now pleaſing unto you, it may
bee that hereafter it may turne to your good. I confeſſe (faire
<hi>Leocadia</hi>) that I lov'd you well, and ſo did you mee; and likewiſe
I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that the ſchedule which I made you, was more to comply with
your deſire, then mine owne. For many dayes before that I had ſigned it and
ſet my hand thereunto, I had delivered up my will and my ſoule to a
<hi>Damſell</hi> of the ſame place, where I live, whom you very well know.
Her name is <hi>Theodoſia,</hi> the daughter (bee it ſpoken without
diſparagement) of as noble parents as yours are. And if I gave you a
ſchedule firmed with my hand, I gave her my firmed hand, and accredited with
ſuch workes and witneſſes, that I remaine impoſſibilited to give my
libertie to any other perſon in the world. That which paſſed betwixt my
ſelfe and <hi>Theodoſia,</hi> was the obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that fruit, which
ſhee could give mee, and which I was willing ſhee ſhould give me,
plighting my faith unto her that I would be (as truly I am) her husband. And if
at one and the ſame time I left both her and you, you ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſefull and
deceived and ſhee fearefull, and (as ſhee thought) robbed of her honour, I
did therein unadviſedly and undeſcreetly, and (as a young man as I am)
without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſcourſe or judgement. Thinking with my ſelfe that all
thoſe things of this nature, were but tricks of youth, and of little or no
importance, and that I might doe them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſcruple at all:
Accompanied with other the like thoughts, which came then in my head, which did
ſolicite me to doe that which I did, which was to goe for <hi>Italy,</hi> and
to imploy therein ſome few of my youthfull yeares, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to returne
home, to ſee what was become of you and of my true Spouſe. But heaven (as
it ſhould ſeeme) being offended, and having complayned of mee to the
higheſt power there, I verily beleeve that God hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted &amp; given
way to put me into that condition, wherein you ſee me, to the end that by
confeſſing theſe truths, ariſing from my many ſins, I may pay in this
life that which I owe,<pb n="43" facs="tcp:58406:25"/>and you remaine diſ-deceived and
free being at your owne liberty to doe that which ſhall ſeeme beſt in
your eyes. And if at any time <hi>Theodoſia</hi> ſhall come to have notice
of my death; ſhee ſhall know both by your
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>elfe and by theſe that are here
preſent, how that at my death I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with that promiſe which I made
her in my life. And if in that little time of life (ſweete <hi>Leocadia</hi>)
which remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth unto me, I may ſerve you in any thing, tell it mee, I
beſeech you, and be it what it will be, I ſhall moſt willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doe it,
ſo as it be not to take you to wife, for that I cannot doe; no other thing
ſhall I refuſe for to give you content; that comes within my
poſſibilitie to performe. Whilſt that <hi>Marco Antonio</hi> went thus
diſcourſing as you have heard, hee reſted his head all that while on his
elbow, and having made an end of ſpeaking hee let his arme fall, giving
ſome ſignes that he was ready to ſwoune. <hi>Don Rafael</hi> haſtned
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently unto him, and ſtreightly imbracing him, ſayd unto him; Sir,
come againe to your ſelfe, bee of good cheere, and imbrace this your friend
and your brother, ſince that it is your pleaſure to have it ſo. Looke up,
and ſee if you know your companion and Chamber-fellow <hi>Don Rafael,</hi>
who will bee a true witneſſe of your good will and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and of the
grace and favour which you are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to doe his ſiſter in admitting her
to be yours. <hi>Marco Antonio</hi> came againe to himſelfe, and inſtantly
knew <hi>Don Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fael,</hi> and imbracing him in his armes, and kiſſing him
on the cheeke, ſayd unto him; The great joy (deare brother) which I have
received in ſeeing you can bring no leſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement with it, then
exceeding great ſorrow. For as it is in the proverbe, after joy comes
ſorrow. But I ſhall give it for well imployed whatſoever ſhall befall
mee, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of that great content which I have received in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you.
Nay then (replyed <hi>Don Rafael,</hi> I will make it more compleate, by
preſenting you with this jewell which is your beloved ſpouſe. And looking
out <hi>Theodoſia</hi> hee found her behind all the company, weeping,
ſuſpenſive, and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,<pb n="44" facs="tcp:58406:26"/>betweene griefe and
joy, as well for that which ſhee ſaw as for that which ſhee heard. Her
brother tooke her by the hand, and ſhee without making reſiſtance,
ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red herſelfe to bee carryed whither hee would leade her; which was to
bring her to <hi>Marco Antonio,</hi> who knew her, and lovingly imbraced her,
both of them guttering downe their cheekes tender and amorous teares. All that
were in the roome were ſtrucken with admiration, in ſeeing ſo ſtrange
an accident. They looked one upon another with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeaking one word,
expecting what would bee the iſſue of theſe things. But
<hi>Leocadia,</hi> having loſt her hopes, though found out the errour, when
ſhee ſaw that with her owne eyes, which <hi>Marco Antonio</hi> did, and
ſaw her whom ſhee tooke to be <hi>Don Rafaels</hi> brother in his armes,
whom ſhee held to be her Husband, and together with this, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her
deſires mock't and her hopes loſt, ſhee ſtole out of all their
ſights, their eyes being earneſtly bent in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding that which the ſick
man did with the Page, whom hee hugged ſo cloſe in his armes. And being
gone out of the roome, ſhee inſtantly made into the ſtreet, with
intention to goe, driven by deſpaire, wandring through the world, or at
leaſt where none might ſee her. But ſcarce had ſhe got into the
ſtreet but <hi>Don Rafael</hi> began to miſſe her, and as if he had
loſt his ſoule hee inquired after her; but no body could tell him which way
ſhee was gone. And ſo without any longer tarrying, like one that was
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate hee went out to ſeeke her, and hyed him with all the haſte he
could thither, where he was told that <hi>Calvete</hi> lodged, leaſt ſhee
might happily have gone thither to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a Mule to ride away; and not
finding her there, hee went like a mad man through the ſtreets, ſearching
after her, one while here, and another while there; and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that ſhee
might peradventure returne backe to the galley, he came to the Sea ſide, and
a little before he came thither, he might heare one call aloud from the
ſhoare for the boate of the Captaine galley, and he knew that the voyce 
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:58406:26"/>that called for it, was that of <hi>Leocadia,</hi> who
being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ealous of ſome ill
intention towards her, hearing one comming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde at her heeles, ſhee layd
her hand upon her Sword, and ſtood upon her guard untill that <hi>Don
Rafael</hi> drew nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer unto her, whom ſhee preſently knew, and it grieved
her to the very heart that he had found her, and more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly all alone
in a place ſo farre from all company, for ſhee had perceived by more
ſhowes then one, which <hi>Don Rafael</hi> had made her, that hee did not
wiſh her ill, but ſo well that ſhee would have taken it for a good
recompence that <hi>Marco Antonio</hi> had loved her but halfe ſo well. With
what words ſhall I now be able to expreſſe thoſe, which <hi>Don
Rafael</hi> uttered to <hi>Leocadia,</hi> opening his ſoule unto her? which
were ſuch &amp; ſo many that I dare not take upon me to ſet them downe,
deſerving a better pen then mine to give them their true life and luſter.
But ſince neceſſitie, and the nature of the ſubject now in hand,
inforceth mee to ſay ſomething, the words, which amongſt many other he
delivered, were in effect theſe. If together with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune which fayleth me,
there ſhould now (faire <hi>Leocadia</hi>) be wanting unto me the courage and
boldneſſe of diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſecrets of my ſoule, there would lye
buried in the boſome of perpetuall oblivion, the moſt inamoured and
honeſteſt affection that ever hath beene, or can be bred in a faithfull and
loving breaſt. But that I may not wrong this my juſt deſire, come what
will come of it, I would have you to know (if your ſurprized thoughts will
but give way to your judgement, and theſe your fits of paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to your
ſounder diſcourſe and reaſon) that in no one thing hath <hi>Marco
Antonio</hi> any advantage of me, ſave onely in this that hee is your
beloved. My linage is as good as his, and in thoſe goods which they call of
Fortune, I am little inferiour unto him; and for the gifts of nature it is not
amiſſe that I ſhould commend my ſelfe, and the rather if in your eyes
they ſhould not be eſteemed. All this I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely lay before you (my
deare Lady and Miſtris) to the<pb n="46" facs="tcp:58406:27"/>end that laying aſide
your paſſion which blindes your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, you might take that
remedy and meanes which fortune now offereth unto you in the utmoſt
extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, and height of your diſgrace: You ſee already, that <hi>Marco
Antonio</hi> cannot be yours, becauſe heaven hath ordaind him for my
ſiſter, and the ſame heaven which this very day hath robd you of
<hi>Marco Antonio,</hi> is willing to make you amends by me, who deſireth no
other happines in this life, then to render up my ſelfe unto you to bee your
husband. Behold and conſider, that good ſucceſſe ſtands calling at
the doores of that ill fortune, which hath hitherto follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you. Neither doe
you ſo much as once imagine, that the boldneſſe and daringneſſe which
you have ſhowed in ſeeking after <hi>Marco Antonio,</hi> ſhall any whit
leſſen the love I beare you, but I ſhall ever highly eſteeme of you,
accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your merits and deſerts, and as if there had never any
affection paſt betweene you. For, in that very houre wherein I deſire and
determine to equall my ſelfe with you, by making choiſe of you to be my
perpetuall Lady and Miſtris, in that very houre, I will forget all, nay
already have forgotten all whatſoever in this particular I have either
ſeene or knowne. For I well wot that thoſe forces which have inforced mee
to goe thus roundly to worke, and letting looſe the reines to my deſire, to
diſpoſe my ſelfe to the giving and delivering up of my ſelfe to bee
wholly yours, the very ſame have brought you to that eſtate wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you
are. And therefore you ſhall not neede to ſeeke out any excuſe where
there hath beene no fault committed. <hi>Leocadia</hi> continued ſilent all
the while that <hi>Don Rafael</hi> ſpake unto her, ſave that now and then
ſhee would fetch deepe ſignes, which came from the very heart roote of her.
<hi>Don Rafael</hi> (taking his hint from this her heavineſſe) grew ſo
bold with her as to take her by the hand, and ſhee not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſtrength to
reſiſt it, kiſſing it againe and againe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating over that
leſſen often; after a little pauſing, he ſayd unto her; Miſtris of my
ſoule, make an end of being wholly<pb n="47" facs="tcp:58406:27"/>mine, let us here make
up this match betweene us in the ſight of this ſtarry Canopie of heaven
which covers us, and of this calme and quiet Sea, which liſtneth unto us, and
of theſe bathed ſands whereon wee tread. Give mee now your conſent,
ſithence that without all doubt it conveneth as well for your honour, as it
doth for my content. Take it once againe into your conſideration, that (as
you know very well) I am a gentleman and rich, and one that truly loves you,
which is that which you ought moſt to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme; and that in ſtead of
finding your ſelfe all alone, and in a habit which doth not ſute ſo well
with your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, farre from the houſe of your parents and kinsfolke,
without any perſon to furniſh you with that which ſhould be needefull for
you, and without all hope of obtayning that which you ſo earneſtly
deſired, you may returne to your owne Countrey in your owne proper honeſt
and true habit, accompanied with as good a husband, as that other whom you had
formerly made choiſe of: you ſhall goe home rich, contented, eſteemed,
and ſerved, and alſo prayſed of all thoſe, to whoſe knowledge ſhall
come the various ſucceſſe of this your Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>If this be ſo, as ſo it is, I know not what you ſhould
ſtick at, or what manner of doubt you can make to your ſelfe. Once more
therefore I ſay unto you, make an end of the buſineſſe, come I ſay,
and rayſe mee from the ground of my miſery, to the heaven of my deſerving
you, for in ſo doing you ſhall finde a heaven for your ſelfe, and cumply
with the lawes of courteſie, and of thankfulneſſe, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your
ſelfe at one and the ſame inſtant both gratefull and diſcreete. Goe to
then (ſayd doubtfull <hi>Leocadia</hi>) ſince that heaven hath ſo
ordained it, and ſince that it is not in my hand, nor in that of any woman
living, to oppoſe herſelfe againſt that which it hath diſpoſed and
determined, let that (Sir) which it, and you will, be done. And heaven it
ſelfe knowes, with what ſhamefaſtneſſe I come to conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend unto
your will; not becauſe I doe not underſtand<pb n="48" facs="tcp:58406:28"/>the great
gaine I make in obeying you, but becauſe I am afrayd that when you have had
your will of me, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed that which you now ſo much deſire, you will
look upon me with other eyes then peradventure you have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, and
repenting you of your bargaine will complaine that they deceived you. But bee
it as it may be, yet how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I am ſure of this, that the name of being
the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wife of <hi>Don Rafaelae Villavicencio</hi> can never bee loſt,
and with this Title onely I will live contented. And if the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and
behaviour which you ſhall ſee in me, after that I am yours, ſhall be a
meanes to make you holde mee in ſome eſteeme, I will give thankes unto
heaven that hath brought me at laſt by, many ſtrange turnings and windings
ſo and by ſo many miſeries to come to the happineſſe to be yours.
Give me <hi>(Senior Don Rafael)</hi> that hand of yours to be mine, and loe
here I give you mine to be yours. And let thoſe ſerve for witneſſes,
which you ſo lately mentioned, the heavens, the Sea, the ſands, and that
ſtill ſilence, onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by my ſighs and your intreaties. Having
ſayd this ſhee ſuffered her ſelfe to bee imbraced, and gave him her
hand, and <hi>Don Rafael</hi> in exchange gave her his, celebrating that
nocturnall and new Nuptialls with onely the ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of a few teares, which
the joy and content thy tooke in deſpight of their forepaſſed ſorrow,
had drawen from their eyes.</p>
            <p>This ceremony ended, they preſently returned to the Knights
houſe, who was very ſory to ſee that they were miſſing, and no
leſſe were <hi>Marco Antonio,</hi> and <hi>Theodoſia,</hi> who by the
hand of a Prieſt were newly eſpouſed, for at the earneſt requeſt and
perſwaſion of <hi>Theodoſia</hi> (to the end that ſome contrary
accident might not trouble that good and happineſſe which ſhee had found)
the knight ſent forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with for one that ſhould marrie them out of hand. So
that when <hi>Don Rafael</hi> and <hi>Leocadia</hi> came in together, and that
<hi>Don Rafael</hi> had recounted unto them what had betided him with
<hi>Leocadia,</hi> it did in ſuch ſort augment their joy, as 
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:58406:28"/>if the knight and the reſt that were there had beene of
their neareſt blood and kindred; for it is the naturall condition, and proper
to the inbred nobleneſſe of the <hi>Catalunians,</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend and
favour ſuch ſtrangers as in their neceſſities have occaſion to uſe
them. The Prieſt that was there preſent gave order that <hi>Leocadia</hi>
ſhould change her habit, and put on ſuch cloathes as ſuited with her
ſex, and the good Knight was not idle in putting thereunto his helping hand;
apparrelling them with the richeſt cloathes that his owne wife had, who was a
principall Lady of the linage of the <hi>Granolleques,</hi> a famous and
ancient familie in that kingdome. The Chirurgion (who out of charitie had
pittie of him that was hurt, tooke notice how that hee talked much and that
they would not ſuffer him to be alone, that hee might take ſome reſt.)
gave expreſſe order that they ſhould leave him in ſilence, and ſay
nothing unto him. But God who had ſo ordayned it, uſing meanes and
inſtruments for the accompliſhing of his workes, when in our eyes hee will
worke ſome wonder, ordayned that the exceſſe of joy, and the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
ſilence which <hi>Marco Antonio</hi> had kept was a great cauſe of his
amendment, ſo that the next day when they dreſt him they found that hee was
out of danger, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in foureteene dayes after hee was ſo well and
perfectly cured that without any feare hee might ſafely travaile, and
undergoe his journey. For I muſt give you to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that at that time
as <hi>Marco Antonio</hi> kept his bed, hee reſolved to goe on pilgrimage a
foote to S. <hi>Iago</hi> of <hi>Ga. licia,</hi> in performance of which
promiſe <hi>Don Rafael, Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadia,</hi> and <hi>Theodoſia,</hi> would
accompany him, and ſo alſo <hi>Calvete</hi> their <hi>Muleter,</hi> a worke
very ſeldome uſed by men of their profeſſion. But the goodneſſe and
plaineneſſe which hee had found in <hi>Don Rafael</hi> oblieged him not to
leave him till that hee were returned to his owne countrey. And ſeeing that
they were to goe a foote like Pilgrims, hee ſent his Mules to
<hi>Salainanca</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:58406:29"/>together with that which was <hi>Don
Rafaels,</hi> for he could not want ſome by whom to ſend them. And now was
the day come of their departure, &amp; having accomodated themſelves with
their Knapſacks and all other neceſſaries they tooke their leave of that
liberall Knight, who had done them ſo many favours, &amp; had given them
ſuch royall entertainment, whoſe name was <hi>Don Sancho de Cardona,</hi>
moſt noble in his blood, and as famous for his perſon; all of them offered
their ſervice unto him, and promiſed not onely for themſelves, but their
decendents, to whom they would leave it in charge, perpetually to keepe in
memory thoſe ſuch ſingular received favours, that they might at leaſt
make a thankfull acknowledgment, though they could not make him a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and reall requitall. <hi>Don Sancho</hi> inbraced all of them one after
another, telling them that it grew from his naturall condition, and was an
imbred diſpoſition that hee had, to doe thoſe or other the like good
offices, to thoſe whom hee knew, or imagined to bee gentlemen of
<hi>Caſtile.</hi> They did twiſe reiterate their imbracings, &amp; with
joy, intermingled with ſome ſence of ſorrow, they tooke their farewell.
And walking on their way with ſuch commoditie and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie, as the
delicateneſſe and tenderneſſe of thoſe two new Pilgrims would permit,
in three dayes they came to <hi>Monſerrate,</hi> and ſtayed there ſo many
more; with the like leaſure they went onward on their way, and without
ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any croſſe accident, or any miſchance at all, they arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at
Saint <hi>Iago.</hi> And after that they had performed their vow, they would
not unfrock themſelves, nor leave off their Pilgrims weedes, till they
ſhould enter into their owne houſes. To which they came by little and
little, and though weary, yet well contented. But before that they came thither
being in ſight of <hi>Leocadias</hi> dwelling which (as wee formerly told
you) was a league off from that of <hi>Theodoſia,</hi> from the toppe of a
high hill they might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> both
their houſes. But as they diſcovered theſe, ſo could they not cover
thoſe teares, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the contentment they <pb n="51" facs="tcp:58406:29"/>tooke in
ſeeing them, brought unto their eyes, at leaſt to the two new brides, who
with their ſight renewed the remembrance of thoſe ſundry ſucceſſes
they had paſſed. They diſcovered likewiſe from that part of the hill
where they ſtood, a large and ſpacious valley, which devided the two
Lordſhips. Wherein they might ſee under the ſhade of an Olive tree, a
tall luſty gentleman, mounted upon a ſquare and ſtrong limmed horſe,
with a white ſhield on his left arme, and a ſtiffe and long Lance well
pointed, in his right. And beholding him with attention, they might likewiſe
perceive, that from among the ſayd Olive trees, came two other gentlemen with
the ſame armes, and with the ſelfe ſame grace and poſture; and anon
after they perceived that all three of them met together, &amp; having ſtayd
a little while together they went apart each from other, and one of thoſe
which came in laſt did goe a pretty diſtance off from him, who ſtood
firſt under the Olive tree, and putting Spurs to their horſes, they
incountred each other with manifeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of being mortall
enemies, beginning to charge each other very bravely and nimbly with their
Launces; ſometimes avoyding the ſtroaks by the ſhifting of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and ſometimes by receiving them on their ſhields with ſuch dexteritie
that they gave good proofe that they were maſters in that exerciſe. The
third man ſtood ſtill as a ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor looking on them without moving from
his place. But <hi>Don Rafael</hi> being impatient of being ſo far off from
them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding ſo well a maintained combate, running with all the ſpeede
he could downe the hill, his ſiſter and his Spouſe following him, in a
very little while hee drew neare unto the two combatants, even juſt then when
as the two Gentletlemen were both of them (though but ſlightly) wounded; and
one of their hats being fallen off, and together with it a burganet of ſteele
that was under it, in the turning aſide of his face <hi>Don Rafael</hi> knew
that it was his father, and <hi>Marco Antonio</hi> likewiſe knew the other to
bee his. <hi>Leocadia,</hi> who had earneſtly eyed him,<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58406:30"/>who did not fight, knew him to bee the father that begat her, with
which ſight all foure were much amazed and aſtoniſhed, and almoſt
beſide themſelves. But this their ſudaine paſſion giving way to
diſcourſe, and reaſon, the two brother in lawes without any more adoe,
preſently made in, and putting themſelves in the midſt betweene thoſe
that fought, they cryed out aloud unto them, ſaying, No more(gentlemen) no
more, it is enough if not too much already, and therefore hold your hands, for
they who crave and beg this of you, are your owne ſonnes. My Lord, and my
father (ſayd <hi>Marco Antonio</hi>) I am <hi>Marco Antonio;</hi> I am hee
for whom (by that which I imagine) theſe your venerable gray hayres are put
to this rigorous ſtreight. Bridle your ſury, and throw away that Lance, or
turne it againſt ſome other enemy, for he whom you have before you from
this day forward, is to bee your brother. To the like purpoſe ſpake <hi>Don
Rafael</hi> to his father, whereupon theſe gentlemen forbore to offend each
other any further. And they then began to looke more wiſſely on thoſe
that uttered theſe ſpeeches, and turning their heads aſide they perceived
that <hi>Don Henrique</hi> the father of <hi>Leocadia,</hi> was alighted from
his horſe, and imbraced him, whom hee tooke to be a pilgrim. For no ſooner
had <hi>Leocadia</hi> come unto him, and made her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe knowne unto him, but
ſhee beſought him that hee would goe and make peace betweene thoſe two
that fought, recounting unto him in few words that <hi>Don Rafael</hi> was her
husband, and that <hi>Marco Antonio</hi> was wedded to <hi>Theodoſia.</hi>
Her father hearing this, preſently diſmounted and imbraced her, as we told
you before. But leaving her, hee baſted to attone the other two, though it
needed not, being that already they had taken notice of their ſonnes, and
were alighted from their horſes, and moſt lovingly imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them, all of
them ſhedding teares, ſpringing out of thoſe two fountaines of Love and
Ioy. They were all cloſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bind, ſtanding together as it were in a Ring,
and began anew to looke on their ſonnes, and knew not what to ſay. 
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58406:30"/>They did touch their bodies with their hands to try
whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were fantaſtick bodies, and walking ſpirits. For their
ſodaine and unexpected comming upon them bred this, and other the like
ſuſpicions and jealouſies; But being ſoone diſ-deceived, and quickly
put out of his errour, they returned afreſh to their teares and imbracements.
And whileſt this was in doing, there appeared to their view in the ſayd
Valley a great number of armed men both on foot and horſeback, which came to
ſide with their ſeverall Lords, and to abet and maintaine their quarrell.
But when they came and ſaw them imbracing thoſe Pilgrims, and teares
ſtanding in their eyes, they allighted and wondring what this ſhould meane,
they ſtood like men amazed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſuch time as <hi>Don Henrique</hi>
briefely delivered unto them that, which his daughter <hi>Leocadia</hi> had
recounted to himſelfe. Hereupon all of them went to imbrace theſe Pilgrims
with ſuch ſhowes and tokens of content, as cannot bee enough endeared.
<hi>Don Rafael</hi> hee likewiſe related unto them with that brevitie as the
time required, all the whole ſucceſſe of his love, and how he came to bee
marryed to <hi>Leocadia,</hi> and his ſiſter <hi>Theodoſia</hi> to
<hi>Marco Antonio;</hi> his father there offering to celebrate theſe their
Nuptialls at his houſe. And this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing agreed upon they brake up and
departed. And ſome of them that were there preſent, haſted away before to
aske <hi>Albricias</hi> of the kinsfolke and friends of thoſe married
couples. <hi>Don Rafael</hi> and <hi>Marco Antonio</hi> in their way
home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as they went talking along, came to know the cauſe of this their
ſtrife and difference; which was as you ſhall heare. The fathers of
<hi>Theodoſia</hi> and <hi>Leocadia</hi> had chalenged <hi>Marco
Antonio's</hi> father, charging him that he was conſenting and privy to
theſe deceits of his ſonne. And both of them being come into the field, and
finding him all alone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſecond, they would not fight with him
upon that oddes and advantage but ſingly one to one, as became gentlemen to
doe; which quarrell muſt have ended in the death of one or both, if they had
not come in ſo luckily as<pb n="54" facs="tcp:58406:31"/>they did. The foure Pilgrims
rendred thankes unto God for this happy ſucceſſe. And ſo the next day
after their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivall, with royall and ſplendide magnificence, and
ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous expence, the father of <hi>Marco Antonio</hi> ſolemnized the
Nuptialls of his ſonne and <hi>Theodoſia,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Don
Rafael</hi> and <hi>Leocadia;</hi> who lived many and happy yeares in the
company of their dearely beloved wives, leaving behinde them a noble ſtocke
and deſcent from father to ſonne, which continueth even to this day in
thoſe two places which are numbred amongſt the beſt of
<hi>Andaluzia.</hi> And if I doe not name them here unto you, it is for that I
deſire to keepe good <hi>decorum</hi> with thoſe two <hi>Damſells,</hi>
whom per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure tongues eyther wickedly malicious, or fooliſhly
ſcrupulous might taxe of lightneſſe in their deſires, and that
ſodaine changing of their habits. Whom I ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate that they will not
goe about to blame ſuch the like liberties and exerciſes, till they looke
back into themſelves and examine their owne hearts, whether they have not at
one time or other beene touched with <hi>Cupids</hi> arrowes; for Love is in
effect a force, (pardon the exorbitancy of the word) that is unreſiſtable,
ſo ſtrong a warre is that, which the appetite wageth againſt reaſon.
<hi>Calvete</hi> the <hi>Muletere</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted well contented with the reward
<hi>Don Rafael</hi> ſent him home to <hi>Salamanca,</hi> and many other gifts
beſtowed on him by the reſt of thoſe that were newly marryed. And the
Poets of thoſe times tooke occaſion for the imploying of their pens, in
extolling the beauty and exaggera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſucceſſe of thoſe two
adventurous, but moſt honeſt Damſells, being the principall ſubject of
this ſtrange ſtory.</p>

friends, being ſtudents in <hi>Salamanca,</hi> reſolved to leave their
ſtudies and to goe for <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> carryed thither by the heate of
their youthfull blood, and by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, which they had (as we uſually
ſay) to ſee the world. And becauſe it ſeemed unto them, that the
exerciſe of Armes though it ſuteth well with all, yet it hath its
principall ſeate and reſidence, and in much better ſorteth with thoſe
that are well borne, and of noble blood.</p>
            <p>They came then to <hi>Flanders,</hi> but at ſuch a time, that
things were in peace and quietneſſe, or upon treatie and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of
being quickly ſo ſetled. They received in <hi>Antwerpe</hi> Letters from
their fathers, wherein they writ, and ſignified unto them the great
diſpleaſure and diſcontentment which they had received, for that they had
left their ſtudies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out adviſing them thereof, to the end that they
might<pb n="56" facs="tcp:58406:32"/>have come ſo fitted and accommodated for
<hi>Planders,</hi> as their birth and qualitie required.</p>
            <p>In concluſion they knowing how this courſe of theirs grieved
their parents, determined to returne back againe to <hi>Spaine,</hi> ſince
that they ſaw there was nothing for them to doe in <hi>Flanders.</hi> Yet
before they would returne, they were very deſirous to ſee all the
famouſeſt Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> and having ſeene all of them, they
ſetled themſelves in <hi>Bolinia,</hi> and admiring the ſtudies of that
famous Vniverſitie, they were willing therein to proſecute theirs. They
gave notice of their intention to their fathers, who were won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully glad of
it, and they expreſſed how well they were pleaſed therewith by
magnificently providing for them, and in ſuch a noble manner that they might
ſhow in their faſhion and carriage, who they were, and of what houſe they
came. And from the very firſt day that they viſited the ſchooles, all
tooke notice of them, and acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them to bee gallant, diſcreete, and
well bred gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Antonio</hi> might be about ſome twenty foure yeares of
age, and <hi>Don Iuan</hi> not above twenty ſix, and they did adrone this
good age of theirs, by being very brave Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, good Muſitians, better
Poets, and very active, and valiant parts that procured them much love, and
made the beſt wiſhes of all thoſe that converſed with them to waite
upon them.</p>
            <p>They had in a very ſhort time wonne unto them many friends, as
well <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſtudents (there being very many of them commonly in
that Vniverſitie) as alſo of thoſe of that Citie, and of ſtrangers.
They ſhewed themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all liberall and bountifull, kinde, and
loving, and farre from that pride and arrogancy (an ordinary faulte) whereof
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> generally uſe to bee taxed. And for that they were
young men and full of jollitie and jocunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe, it was not unpleaſing
unto them to take notice of the beſt beauties of that Citie; and albeit there
were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny<pb n="57" facs="tcp:58406:32"/>Gentlewomen both maidens and married wives, that
had a good report of being both faire and honeſt, yet above all, the Lady
<hi>Cornelia Bentivogli</hi> bore the bell, being of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and noble
family of the <hi>Bentivogli's,</hi> who were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Lords of
<hi>Bolonia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cornelia</hi> was extremely fayre and beautifull, and was
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the guard and protection of <hi>Lorenzo Bentivogli</hi> her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a
moſt honorable and valiant gentleman, being both fatherleſſe and
motherleſſe. And although they left them thus all alone, yet did they leave
them exceeding rich. <hi>And riches to Orphaneſhip, is a great eaſe and
comfort,</hi> ſo great was <hi>Cornelia's</hi> retiredneſſe, and ſo
great her brothers care and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude in guarding her, that ſhee neither
ſuffered herſelfe to be ſeene, nor would her brother permit that any
ſhould ſee her.</p>
            <p>This fame and report of her rare beauty made <hi>Don Iuan,</hi>
and <hi>Don Antonio</hi> very deſirous to have a ſight of her. But the
labour they tooke therein was loſt and all in vaine, and their deſire by
reaſon of the impoſſibilitie of obtaining, had in ſuch ſort cut off
all hope thereof, that it went by degrees decreaſing and diminiſhing. And
therefore being now wholly taken up with the love of their ſtudies, and with
the entertainment of ſome honeſt recreations of youth, they led an honeſt
and merry life together; they ſeldome rambled abroad in the night, and when
they did, they went both together well armed.</p>
            <p>It afterwards ſo fell out, that being to goe forth one night
<hi>Don Antonio</hi> told <hi>Don Iuan</hi> that hee would ſtay a while, but
would have him to goe, promiſing that he would preſently follow him. That
ſhall not neede (replyed <hi>Don Iuan</hi>) for I will ſtay for you; and if
we ſhould not goe abroad this night the matter is not great. No, as you love
mee (ſayd <hi>Don Antonio</hi>) get you gone and take the ayre for I will bee
inſtantly with you, if you walke that round, which wee uſe to doe. Doe what
you thinke good, (anſwered <hi>Don Iuan</hi>) fare you well, 
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:58406:33"/>and if you ſhall walke forth, I will goe the ſame
ſtations this night as I did the laſt; <hi>Don Iuan</hi> went his way, and
<hi>Don Antonio</hi> ſtayd behinde.</p>
            <p>The night was ſomewhat darke and duskie, and the hower eleven,
and having gone through two, or three ſtreets, and ſeeing himſelfe all
alone, and that hee had no body with whom to talke and converſe, he
reſolved with himſelfe to returne home, and putting it in execution
paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing through a ſtreete, which had a walking place built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Pillars
of marble, he might heare from a certaine doore that ſome did whiſte unto
him with a ſoft and low voyce. The darkneſſe of the night, which was made
the more by meanes of that cloſe walke, would not let him gueſſe and
conjecture whence that whiſting directly came. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hee ſtood ſtill
a while, attentively liſtning whence it ſhould come, and whileſt he was
thus buſied, he might ſee a doore halfe way open it ſelfe; He drew neare
thereunto, and might heare a low voyce which ſpake thus. Is it <hi>Fabio? Don
Iuan</hi> anſwered, yes. Then take this (replyed they within) and have a care
to have it ſafely kept, and returne hither pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently againe, for it much
importeth us. <hi>Don Iuan</hi> puts forth his hand, and felt a bulke, he knew
not what, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to take it with one of his hands, hee found that he had
need to uſe both, and they had ſcarce put it into his hands, but they
ſhut the doore upon him, and left him And hee went his way &amp; found
himſelfe in the ſtreet with his hands full, but knew not what burthen he
bare. But within a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while after he heard a babe beginne to cry, which it
ſhould ſeeme had beene but newly borne. Whereat <hi>Don Iuan</hi> remayned
amazed and ſuſpenſive, not knowing what he ſhould doe, or what courſe
to take in this ſtrange caſe. For to returne back to the doore, and call
there unto them, he conſidered with himſelfe, that he might run ſome
danger for the babes ſake, having perſonated another man to whom it was
intended, and in leaving it there at the doore, the babe might have its life
hazarded. And to carry it<pb n="59" facs="tcp:58406:33"/>home to his owne houſe hee had
not any one there that could give it the teate, and thoſe other helpes that
were needefull, nor did hee know in all the Citie any body whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he might
carry it. But ſithence that they had ſayd unto him that he ſhould ſee
it ſafe and returne againe preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he determined to carry it to his owne
houſe, and to leave it in the power and cuſtody of a woman that ſerved
them, and to returne forthwith to ſee whether or no they had any further
neede of his ſervice, ſince that he plainely perceived that they had taken
him for another, and that it was a meere miſtake in giving the babe unto
him.</p>
            <p>In concluſion, without making any further diſcourſes, he
came home with it to his houſe, when as <hi>Don Antonio</hi> was not there.
He entred into one of the roomes next at hand, and called his woman ſervant
unto him, and cauſed her to unſwathe the babe, and found it to bee one of
the fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt creatures that ever they had ſeene. The cloathes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it
was lapt, told that it came of rich and noble parents. When the woman had
unſwathed and opened it, they ſaw that it was a man childe. Then ſayd
<hi>Don Iuan</hi> to his woman, wee muſt needs get one to give this childe
ſuck; but firſt of all I would have you take away theſe ritch Mantles,
and lay them aſide in ſome ſafe place, and to put and wrap it in others
more meane and humble. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making it knowne, that I brought it hither
you ſhall carry it to the houſe of ſome one Midwife or other, for ſuch
kinde of women are never commonly unprovided of neceſſary remedy in ſuch
like neceſſities, you ſhall take mony along with you, wherewith ſhee
may remaine ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied and contented, and you ſhall give it ſuch parents,
as you your ſelfe ſhall thinke fit, for the better covering of the truth of
my bringing it hither. His woman made anſwere, all ſhould be done as he had
ordered it.</p>
            <p>This buſineſſe was no ſooner put into ſo good a way, but
that <hi>Don Iuan</hi> with all the haſte hee could returned to ſee whether
they would whiſte, once more unto him;<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58406:34"/>but a little before
that hee came to the ſayd houſe where they had called unto him, he might
heare a great claſhing of ſwords, as if many had beene together by the
eares ſlaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another. He ſtood liſtning a while, but could not
heare any one word paſſe betweene them. This hamme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Iron was in the
darke, ſave onely that by the light of thoſe ſparks which the ſtones,
wounded by their ſwords; rayſed, he had a glimpſe that there were many
that had ſet upon one, and he was confirmed in this truth by hearing that one
ſay; O traytours, though yee be many and I but a ſingle man, yet ſhall
not your overmatching me in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber make you prevaile in your purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Which <hi>Don Iuan</hi> hearing and ſeeing, tranſported by his
va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant heart, at two leapes, he made into the ſide of him that was
aſſaulted, and taking his ſword in one hand, and his buckler which hee
brought along with him in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he ſayd unto him that defended
himſelfe, in the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian tongue, that he might not bee knowne to be a
<hi>Spaniard.</hi> Feare you nothing (Sir) for ſuch ſuccour is now come to
you, as ſhall not ſayle you till his life faile. Beſtirre your ſelfe,
and ſet your ſelſe roundly to them; <hi>for traytours though they be
many, are able to doe but little.</hi> To theſe words replyed one of the
adverſe part; thou lyeſt in thy throate, for here is no traytour; but for
the recovering of a mans loſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, it is lawfull to take this, or any
other advantage what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
            <p>There paſſed no more words betweene them, becauſe the
haſte which they made to offend and wound their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, would not give them
leave to talke, who were (to <hi>Don Iuans</hi> ſeeming) ſome ſix of
them. They did preſſe ſo hard upon his companion, that at two home
thruſts which they made at him at once full in his breſt, they layd him
flat on the ground. <hi>Don Iuan</hi> thought that they had kild him, and with
ſtrange nimbleneſſe and valour hee beſtird him, and ſet upon them
all, whom hee made to give ground by the force of a ſhower which hee rayned 
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58406:34"/>downe upon them of blowes and thruſts.</p>
            <p>But all his diligence had not beene able for to offend them, and
defend himſelfe, if good fortune had not offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him her ayde, by cauſing
the neighbours thereabouts in that ſtreete to open their windowes and come
forth with lights, and to call out aloud to the Iuſtice Which they of the
contrary part perceiving, forſooke the ſtreet, and turning their backs,
went their way.</p>
            <p>Now by this time hee that was fallen had got up againe, for
thoſe <hi>Stocados</hi> and thruſts that were made at him, lighted on a
privy coate which he had, that was as hard and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrable as if it had beene
a rock of Diamonds. <hi>Don Iuan</hi> in this fray had let fall his hat, and
ſeeking for it, in ſtead of his owne, lighted by chance on another, which
he clapt on his head without looking whether it were his owne or no.</p>
            <p>His fellowe that was fallen, came unto him, and ſayd, Sir
whoſoever you be, I confeſſe that I am indebted to you for my life, the
which with all that my eſtate beſides can reach unto, I will ſpend in
your ſervice. Let me intreate you to doe me the favour to tell mee who you
are, and what is your name, to the end that I may know to whom I owe ſo much
that I may manifeſt my thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>Whereunto replyed <hi>Don Iuan,</hi> I will not (Sir) ſeeing my
ſelfe now disintereſſed, be diſcourteous with you. To cumply therefore
with your deſire, and to fulfill your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, I ſhall onely tell you
that I am a gentleman, a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and a ſtudent in this
Vniverſitie, if the knowing of my name may any whit import you, I ſhall
tell it you. But if happily you ſhall bee pleaſed in any other thing to
make uſe of my ſervice, I would then (Sir) have you to know, that my name
is <hi>Don Iuan de Gamboa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have done mee a great favour herein replyed hee that was
fallen. But I <hi>(Senior Don Iuan de Gamboa)</hi> will not tell you who I am,
nor my name, becauſe I am willing you<pb n="62" facs="tcp:58406:35"/>ſhould rather know
it from another then my ſelfe, and I will take care, that both ſhall bee
made knowne unto you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Iuan</hi> had but a little before asked of him, whether or
no he had not received ſome hurt, becauſe hee ſaw that they had given him
two great <hi>ſtocadas;</hi> whereunto he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that the goodneſſe
of his privy coate next under God had defended him. But that yet
notwithſtanding his enemies had made an end of him, if hee had not ſtuck
ſo cloſe unto him.</p>
            <p>By this time there came towards them a company of people more in
number then thoſe they had before to doe withall; whereupon <hi>Don Iuan</hi>
ſayd, if theſe bee thoſe our enemies, ſtand (Sir) upon your guard, and
behave your ſelfe like your ſelfe. I beleeve (replyed the other) that they
are not enemies but friends which make towards us. And it was ſo indeed. For
they that came, were in all eight per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who compaſſed him round that
was fallen, and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpered ſome few words in his eare but they were ſo
ſoft and ſo ſecret, that <hi>Don Iuan</hi> could not heare them.</p>
            <p>The partie defended turned preſently aſide from them to
<hi>Don Iuan,</hi> and ſayd unto him, had not theſe my friends come in unto
me, I would by no meanes <hi>(Senior Don Iuan)</hi> have left you, till you had
finiſhed this your well begun worke by ſetting mee in ſome place of
ſafetie. But now with all the indearingneſſe that I can, I ſhall
intreate you that you will leave me, for it much importeth mee, that you yeeld
to my requeſte. Having ſayd this, hee put his hand to his head, and found
that he was without a hat, and turning himſelfe to thoſe that came to him,
he ſpake unto them to give him a hat, for his owne was in fighting falne from
him. He had ſcarce ſpoke the word, but that <hi>Don Iuan</hi> put that
which he had found upon his head. He that fell felt it with his hand, and
returning it to <hi>Don Iuan</hi> ſayd unto him; this hat is none of mine. As
you love me, <hi>(Don Iuan)</hi> take it, and carry it away with you as a
Trophee of this<pb n="63" facs="tcp:58406:35"/>skirmiſh, and keepe it well, for I beleeve
it is knowne. They gave him another hat, and <hi>Don Iuan</hi> for to comply
with that which he had intreated of him, interchanging ſome other but
ſhorte compliments, he left him, not knowing who he was, and came home to his
owne houſe, without offering to goe to that doore, where they had given him
the babe, becauſe he perceived that all the whole ſtreet was up, being
awakened out of their ſleepe, and in a kinde of tumult and uproare by
reaſon of this quarrell.</p>
            <p>It ſo then happened that in his returning to his lodging he met
in the mid way with <hi>Don Antonio de Yſunca</hi> his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade, and knowing
him, <hi>Don Antonio</hi> ſayd, returne with me <hi>(Don Iuan)</hi> a little
up this way, and as we walke along, I ſhall recount unto you a ſtrange
ſtory which hath befallen mee; and I beleeve in all your life you never heard
ſuch paſſages as I ſhall now acquaint you with. Whereunto <hi>Don
Iuan</hi> replyed, come let us goe whither you will, and tell me this your
ſtrange ſtory. <hi>Don Antonio</hi> led the way and ſayd.</p>
            <p>You ſhall underſtand that little more then an houre af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that you were gone out of the houſe, I went forth to ſeeke you, and not 30.
paces from this place I ſaw com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming as it were to meete me, the black bulke
of ſome perſon, which came in great haſte, and the party approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nearer unto me, I knew it was a woman clad in a long habit, who with a voyce
interrupted with ſighes and ſobs, ſayd unto me; are you (Sir) a
ſtranger or one of the Cities I replyd, a ſtranger and a <hi>Spaniard;</hi>
Are you wounded (Lady) or doe you beare about you ſome evill preſages of
death? It may be (quoth ſhee) that the evill I bring with me, will be my
death if I have not ſpeedy remedy. By that courteſie which is alwayes wont
to raigne in thoſe of your Nation, I beſeech you (noble <hi>Spaniard</hi>)
that you will take mee our of theſe ſtreets and bring mee to your lodging
with the greateſt ſpeed you can, and there if it pleaſe you, you ſhall
know the evill I beare about me, and who I am, though it bee to the coſt of
my credit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:58406:36"/>Hearing her ſay ſo, it ſeeming unto me,
that ſhe had neede of that which ſhe deſired, without making any reply, I
tooke her by the arme, and through by lanes, brought her to my lodging.
<hi>Santiſtevan</hi> the Page opened mee the doore, I willed him to with draw
himſelfe, and ſo without his ſeeing of her, I conducted her to my
chamber. Whereinto ſhee was no ſooner entred, but ſhee threw her ſelfe
on my bed, and fell ſuddainely into a ſwoune; I drew neare unto her and
uncovered her face which ſhee had covered with her mantle, and diſcovered
therein the greateſt beautie, that humane eyes had ever ſeene; ſhee might
be to my ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming about ſome eighteene yeares of age, rather under then
over. I ſtood a while amazed at the beholding of ſuch rare and ſingular
beautie. But calling my ſelfe to remembrance I haſtned to ſprinkle a
little water on her face, wherewith ſhee came to her ſelfe, tenderly
ſighing. And the firſt word that ſhee ſpake unto me was; Doe you know
me Sir? No (quoth I) nor is it fitting that I ſhould have had the
hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe to have knowne ſo much beauty. O unhappy is that beautie
(ſayd ſhee) which heaven beſtowes upon ſome for their greater
misfortune. But this (gentle Sir) is no time to commend beautie but to remedy
miſchiefes, I ſhall therefore intreate you by that worth and nobleneſſe
that is in you, that you will leave mee heere ſhut up, and ſuffer none to
ſee me, and that you will preſently returne to the ſame place where you
met with me, and ſee if there be any maintaining a quarrell each with other:
Side (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you) with neither part, nor favour any of thoſe that you
finde in this duell, but ſeeke to make peace betweene them, for whatſoever
hurt ſhall light on eyther ſide, it will helpe to make mine the gaeater. I
left her ſhut up, and am going to ſee if I can end this difference and make
them friends.</p>
            <p>Have you any more to ſay, <hi>Don Antonio?</hi> (ſayd <hi>Don
Iuan</hi>) Why doe not you thinke that I have ſayd enough (replyed <hi>Don
Antonio</hi>) ſince that I have told you, that I have under 
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:58406:36"/>lock and key in my Chamber, the greateſt beauty which
humane eyes ever ſaw? Doubtleſſe it is a ſtrange caſe, (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<hi>Don Iuan;</hi>) but now I pray hearken what betided me. And preſently he
related unto him all the whole ſucceſſe of his buſineſſe, and how
that the babe, which they had given him was at home in the houſe in the
cuſtody and keeping of his ſhee-ſervant, and the oder that he had left
with her for the changing of thoſe rich into poore Mantles, and to carry him
to ſome Nurſe that might breed him up, or at leaſt to relieve this its
preſent neceſſitie by giving it ſuck: and he ſignified further unto
him, that the difference, which he came to inquire after was ended, &amp; that
all was well and quiet, &amp; how that he himſelfe was in that quarrell, and
that all thoſe (as hee did imagine) who were in that bickering were gentlemen
of great both qualitie &amp; valour. They both did bleſſe themſelves, and
did wonder and admire at each others fortune, &amp; ſo made all the haſte
they could to returne home, for to ſee what the lockt up Lady had neede
of.</p>
            <p>In their way homeward <hi>Don Antonio</hi> tolde <hi>Don
Iuan,</hi> that he had promiſed that gentlewoman that none ſhould ſee
her, nor come into that Chamber ſave onely himſelfe, ſince that there was
not any one thing, wherein he could doe her a greater courteſie. Tuſh
that's nothing (ſayd <hi>Don Iuan</hi>) I will not want ſome one deviſe
or other for to have a ſight of her, for already I long extreamely to ſee
her, you having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſuch extraordinary commendation of her beautie.</p>
            <p>Whilſt they were thus diſcourſing on the buſineſſe,
and (by the light which one of thoſe their Pages brought) <hi>Don
Antonio</hi> by chance caſting his eyes on the hat which <hi>Don Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
wore, he ſaw how it did glitter &amp; ſhine with diamonds. He took it off
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his head, &amp; ſaw, that thoſe ſparkling lights beamed forth their
rayes from their fellowes which were curiouſly ranked in an exceeding rich
hat-band. They both of them looked againe and againe upon it, and having well
viewd it, they concluded that if they were all fine and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as they
appeared to be, they could not be leſſe worth<pb n="66" facs="tcp:58406:37"/>then
twelve or thirteene thouſand duckets. By this they certainly knew that they
in this quarrell were perſons of principall note and qualitie, eſpecially
be that was ſuccou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by <hi>Don Iuan</hi> who (as he well remembred) told
him that he ſhould take the hat with him and keepe it, becauſe it was
knowne.</p>
            <p>They commanded their pages to withdraw, they did ſo; then
<hi>Don Antonio</hi> opened the doore to his chamber, and found the Lady
ſitting on the bed, leaning her cheeke on her hand, trilling downe tender
teares.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Iuan,</hi> out of the deſire which he had to ſee her,
made a ſhift to put his head halfe way within the doore, which he had no
ſooner done, but in that very inſtant the glitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Diamonds
ſhined on thoſe eyes which rayned downe ſoft ſhowers of teares, and
lifting them up, ſhee ſaid come in (my Lord Duke) come in, why will you
give me with ſo ſparing a hand the riches of your preſence.</p>
            <p>Hereunto (replyed <hi>Don Antonio</hi>) here Lady is no Duke that
neede to excuſe himſelfe for his not ſeeing of you. How (ſaid ſhee)
no Duke? he that did peepe in at the doore even now is the Duke of
<hi>Ferrara;</hi> whom the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his hat cannot conceale from me.
Truly (Lady) I can aſſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſeeing that bee had leave given him to enter, with his, hat in his hand he
came into the Chamber, and as ſoone as he had thus preſented himſelfe
before her, ſhee preſently knew that he who had this rich hat was not the

happily alive? Or is this the newes which hee ſends mee of his death? O my
deareſt good! what ſtrange ſucceſſes are theſe? Is it poſſible
that I ſhould ſee thy pledges here, and yet ſee my ſelfe without thee
ſhut up in a chamber, and in the power of I know not what <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
gentlemen? O the feare of looſing my honeſtie, would it would quit mee of
my life! Patient your ſelfe (Madam) ſayd <hi>Don Iuan.</hi> For neither is
the owner of this hat dead, neither are you in ſuch hands that you ſhall
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any the leaſt wrong in the world, but ſhall be ready to ſerve
you, as farre forth as their force and ſtrength can reach, even to the laying
downe of their lives for to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and protect you. For it is not meete, that
that faith of yours ſhould prove vaine, which you have of the
<hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> goodneſſe. And ſince that wee are of that nation and
principall men in our countrey, (for here and on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, that may
well now become me to ſay, which elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where might be accounted arrogancy)
be confident (Lady) and reſt you right well aſſured, that that decorum
towards you ſhall bee kept and obſerved, which your noble and gracefull
preſence deſerveth.</p>
            <p>I beleeve (replyed ſhee) no leſſe, but notwithſtanding I
pray Sir tell me, how this rich hat came into your poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Or
where is its maſter who beſides his other titles is <hi>Alfonſo de
Eſte,</hi> Duke of <hi>Ferrara?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then <hi>Don Iuan,</hi> that he might not holde her further in
ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpence, recounted unto her how that he found one in a quarrell, &amp;
that himſelfe tooke part with a gentleman who in all likelihood, by that
which he had gathered from her ſpeeches, muſt be the Duke of
<hi>Ferrara.</hi> And that in the fray he had loſt his hat, as I likewiſe
had mine, and by chance lighted on this in ſtead of mine owne; and that the
ſayd gentleman when I offered it unto him, hee wanting a hat (not knowing
then whether it was his or mine owne,<pb n="68" facs="tcp:58406:38"/>for it was darke)
intreated me to keepe it, for it was a hat that was well knowne, and that the
quarrell was ended without the gentlemans receiving any hurt or himſelfe: And
that after all was ended there came in ſome company which to his ſeeming
were either the ſervants or friends of him, whom he imagined to be the Duke,
who beſought me that I would leave him, and ſo we parted, he ſhowing
himſelfe very thankefull for the aſſiſtance which I had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him. So
that (ſwete Lady) this rich hat came into my power juſt in the ſame
manner as I have delivered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, and its owner (if it be the Duke as you
ſpeake him to be) it is not a full hower ſince I left him ſafe and
ſound. Let this truth ſuffice in part for your comfort (if hee be the man
wee both pitch upon) that you know the Duke is well.</p>
            <p>To the end (gentlemen) that yee likewiſe may know whether I have
reaſon or good cauſe or no, for to inquire after him; be attentive, and
liſten unto mee, and you ſhall heare (I know not what other name I may give
it) my ſad and unfortunate Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>All the while that this paſſed, their ſhee ſervant
entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her ſelfe in feeding the babe with honey and in chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thoſe his rich into poore mantles. And now that ſhee had quite made an end
of dreſſing it, ſhe was going to carry it to the houſe of ſome
Midwife as <hi>Don Iuan</hi> willed her. And paſſing with the babe cloſe
by the Chamber where ſhee was, who was about to begin her promiſed
Hiſtory, the poore little thing cride, and ſo ſtrongly that the Lady
heard it, and ſtarting upon her feet, ſhe did attentively liſten
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and heard the cry more diſtinctly and ſayd, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, what
creature is that which ſeemeth to be but new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly borne? it is a childe (ſayd
<hi>Don Iuan</hi>) which this night was laid at our doore, and ſhee that
lookes to our houſe, is going to ſeeke out one that may give it ſucke.
For Gods ſake bring it hither to me (ſayd the Lady) for I will doe this
charitable office for other folkes children, ſince hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven<pb n="69" facs="tcp:58406:38"/>will not let mee doe it to mine owne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Iuan</hi> called in the woman, and tooke the childe from
her, and to ſatisfie her deſire, put the babe into her armes; ſaying
withall, you ſee (Lady) the preſent that hath this night beene beſtowed
upon us. And this is no newes, for few moneths goe over our heads, but that wee
finde at our doores ſuch kinde of unlookt for commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.</p>
            <p>Shee tooke the babe into her armes, and ſhee looked wiſſely
as well on his face, as on thoſe poore, though cleane cloathes, wherein it
was wrapt, and preſently without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to refraine weeping, the tender
teares trickling downe her cheekes, ſhee threw the vayle that covered her
head over her breſts, that ſhee might with the more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie give the
babe ſucke, and applying it to her breſt ſhee joyned her face to his, and
did feede it with her milke, and bathe the face of it with her teares. And in
this manner ſhee continued without lifting up hers ſo long as the childe
did not leave the teate.</p>
            <p>In the interim, all foure of them remayned ſilent. The child
ſuckt indeede, but drew no milke, for they that are newly delivered, cannot
preſently give the breſt. And ſo ſhee falling into the reckoning what
little or no ſuſtenance ſhee gave it, ſhee returned the babe to <hi>Don
Iuan,</hi> ſaying, in vaine have I have I ſhew'd my ſelfe charitable, I
ſeeme to be but a Novice in theſe caſes. I pray (Sir) give order that
this child have his palate moyſtned with a little honey, and by no meanes
give way that it be carryed out in the open ayre at this time of night through
the ſtreets, let it be day firſt, and before that it be carryed hence,
bring it once more againe unto me, for I take great comfort in looking upon
it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Iuan</hi> returned the babe to the woman, and gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that ſhe ſhould entertaine the time with the child till it were day, and
that dreſſing it up as neately and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely as ſhee could, ſhee
ſhould put thereon thoſe rich<pb n="70" facs="tcp:58406:39"/>Mantles, wherein he
brought it thither, and that ſhe ſhould not bring the babe unto him, till
he firſt called for it. This done, comming againe into the Chamber, and they
three being all alone, this faire Lady ſayd unto them.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, if you will have me to ſpeake, give mee firſt
ſomething to eate, for I feele my ſelfe begin to faint, and not without
cauſe, conſidering the manifold occaſions of my griefe. <hi>Don
Antonio</hi> ranne preſently to his Cabinet, and tooke forth ſundry ſorts
of Conſerves, and other ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meates, whereof this fainting Lady did eate
ſome, wherewith ſhee came to her ſelfe, having dranke a draught of cold
water after them, and being now ſomewhat quieted and of better cheere and
comfort, ſhee ſayd, ſit downe (Gentlemen) and hearken unto me. They did
ſo; And ſhee rayſing her ſelfe up on the bed, ſitting thereon upright
and covering her feete well with the skirts of her cloathes, ſhee let fall on
her ſhoulders a vayle which ſhee ware on her head, leaving her face bare
and open, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the Moone in its cleareneſſe, or rather the Sunne
when it ſhineth brighteſt. Liquid pearles did diſtill downe from her
eyes, which ſhee wiped away with a moſt pure white Hand-kercher and with
ſuch hands, that betweene them and the linnen, he muſt have a good
diſcerning judgement that could diſtinguiſh and difference their ſnowy
whiteneſſe. In fine, after that ſhee had vented ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſighes, and after
that ſhee had procured the eaſing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of her breaſt, with
ſomewhat a ſorrowfull and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled voyce, ſhee ſpake thus.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, I am ſhee whom doubtleſſe you have often heard
named in this Citie, becauſe there are very few tongues which have not
publiſhed the fame of my beauty ſuch as it is. In a word I am <hi>Cornelia
Bentivogli,</hi> ſiſter to <hi>Lorenzo Bentivogli,</hi> and in ſaying
this, I ſhall happily have ſayd two truths. The one of my nobleneſſe of
birth, the other of my beautie. Being very young I was left fathereleſſe
and motherleſſe, in the power of my brother, who from my<pb n="71" facs="tcp:58406:39"/>childhood put upon me for my guard warineſſe and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection
it ſelfe; though that hee did more rely upon my honeſt and honorable
condition, then on that ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and heedefulneſſe, which hee had
taken in guarding me. In concluſion, confined within walls and ſolitudes,
accompanied with no other ſave my maide-ſervants, I went increaſing in
yeares and growth, and together with mee, went increaſing the fame of my
properneſſe of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, beautie and comelineſſe, proclaymed in
publicke by ſome of my men-ſervants, and by thoſe who privately treated
with me, and by a picture which my brother cauſed to be drawne by a famous
Painter to the end, that, (as he ſayd) the world ſhould not remaine without
mee, if heaven ſhould take me here to a better life. But all this had beene
but the leaſt part of haſtning my perdition, had not the Duke of
<hi>Ferrara</hi> come to a Kinſwomans wedding of mine, being invited to doe
her the honour to give her in Church, whither my brother carried mee with a
good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and for to grace this my kinſwoman. There I ſaw and was
ſeene; there I conceive I tooke hearts cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and made them doe
vaſſalage and homage to my will; There I perceived that I was well
pleaſed with their prayles, though they were given me by flattering tongues;
there, laſtly, I ſaw the Duke, and he ſaw me; from which interview I am
now brought to ſee my ſelfe in that ſtate, wherein you now ſee I
am.</p>
            <p>I will not (gentlemen) relate unto you (for that were but to make
my diſcourſe infinite) the devices, the plots, and the meanes, whereby the
Duke and my ſelfe came at the end of two yeares, to obtaine thoſe
deſires, which had their birth at the wedding. For neither guardings nor
watchings, nor brotherly admonitions, nor any other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane dilligences were
ſufficient for to hinder our ſecret meetings, and injoying each other. But
before I would yeeld unto his pleaſure, he gave me his faithfull word and
promiſe for to marry me, and make me his wife, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out 
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:58406:40"/>this plighting of his troth unto mee, it had beene
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him to have made me render and yeelde up the forte of my
virginitie upon diſhonourable tearmes.</p>
            <p>I ſpake unto him a thouſand times and more, that hee would
move my brother in publick for me, being that it was not poſſible, that he
would deny him me, and that the Duke needed not to excuſe himſelfe to the
vulgar, if they ſhould chance to taxe him, with the inequalitie and
diſparitie of the marriage, as ſomewhat to meane for him, ſince that the
nobleneſſe of the Linage of the <hi>Bentivogli's,</hi> was no whit
inferiour to that of the houſe of <hi>Eſte.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this propoſition of mine he anſwered me with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes,
intreating me that I would approve of them, as ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, and
neceſſary, and I giving credit unto them (having already rendred up my
ſelfe unto him) I did as one that was in love, beleeve the beſt, and
preſt him no further; but ſubmitted my will wholly unto his, at the
interceſſion of a maide-ſervant of mine, who by the Dukes large gifts and
promiſes, was as plyable as wax, not regarding (as ſhe ought to have done)
the truth and confidence which my brother had of her fidelitie.</p>
            <p>In concluſion, within a few dayes after I found my ſelfe with
childe, and before that my cloaths ſhould manifeſt my liberties (that I may
not give it any other name) I feig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned my ſelfe ſicke and melancholly, and
wrought my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to bring mee to that my kinſwomans houſe, whom the Duke
gave in marriage.</p>
            <p>There did I make known in what caſe I was, the danger that did
threaten me, and the ſmall aſſurance that I had of my life, becauſe I
was jealous that my brother ſuſpected my looſeneſſe; it was agreed
upon betweene the Duke &amp; my ſelfe, that when I was upon my laſt moneth
I ſhould adviſe him of it, and that hee with other of his friends would
come for mee, and carry mee with him to <hi>Ferrara,</hi> where in the time by
him expected he would marry mee in publicke.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:58406:40"/>This very night was that concluded on for his
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and this very night wayting and looking for him, I heard my brother
paſſe by with many other men to my ſeeming armed by the clattering of
their armes, by reaſon of which ſuddaine &amp; unexpected feare,
paſſion prevailed ſo far with me that my throwes came upon me, and
inſtantly brought forth a faire ſon. That maid-ſervant of mine, who was
privie to my actions, and the Dukes ſolicitreſſe, ſeeing her ſelfe
now prevented by this ſodaine chance wrapt the babe in other cloaths then
thoſe the child had, which was laid at your doore. And going to the doore
that opened to the ſtreet ſhee gave it (as ſhee told mee) to a ſervant
of the Dukes. I within a little while after accommodating my ſelfe the beſt
I could, according to my preſent neceſſitie, got me out of the houſe,
verily beleeving that the Duke was in the ſtreet, which indeed I ought not to
have done til he had come to the doore. But the feare which that armed troope
of my brother had put mee into, thinking that hee was now brandiſhing his
ſword over my neck, it did not give me leave to make any better
diſcourſe, and ſo unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly and fooliſhly I went forth, where that
has befallen me which you now ſee. And albeit I ſee my ſelfe without a
ſon, &amp; without a husband, and with feare of worſe ſucces, yet doe I
give thanks unto heaven for having brought me into your hands, from which I
promiſe all that unto my ſelfe which <hi>Spaniſh</hi> courteſie can
promiſe me, &amp; more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly yours, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> for that you are ſo noble
as you ſeeme to be, you know the better how, and where to extend it.</p>
            <p>Having ſayd this ſhee ſuffered her ſelfe to ſinke downe
from the toppe of the bed, and the two gentlemen draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neare unto her, to
ſee whether ſhe were fainting and falling into a ſwound, they ſaw it
was not ſo, but onely that ſhe wept bitterly. Whereupon <hi>Don Iuan</hi>
ſayd unto her.</p>
            <p>If hitherto (faire Lady) my ſelfe and <hi>Don Antonio</hi> my
friend and companion, have had compaſſion of you, and pittied your caſe,
as you were a woman, now that we know your<pb n="74" facs="tcp:58406:41"/>quality, that
pitty and compaſſion comes to bee a preciſe obligation, binding us to
ſerve you. Be of good cheere, be not diſmayd, and though you have not bin
accuſtomed to ſuch like chances; yet ſhall you by ſo much the more
ſhow who you are by how much the more patiently you ſhall beare your
misfortunes. Beleeve me (Madam) I am of the minde that theſe ſuch ſtrange
ſucceſſes will have a happy end, for the heavens will never permit that
ſo much beauty ſhould be ill injoyed, and ſuch honeſt thoughts ſo ill
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded. Betake your ſelfe (Lady) to your reſt, and have a care of your
perſon, for it is no more then needeth, and here ſhall a woman ſervant of
ours come in to ſerve you, and waite upon you, of whom you may be as
confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as you are of us, ſhee likewiſe knowes as well how to ſilence
your misfortunes, as ſhe doth to aſſiſt you in theſe your
neceſſities. Such a one I take her to be, that I dare bee bold to ſay
that ſhee will adventure to wade through all difficulties that you ſhall
put her to.</p>
            <p>Shee made anſwer, let her (Sir) ſince you will have it ſo,
come in; for being tendred to mee by ſo good a hand as yours, I cannot but
hold her to be very uſefull in all that, wherein I ſhall have occaſion to
imploy her. But I beſeech you (Sir) let none more then this good woman ſee
me. On my word (replyed <hi>Don Antonio</hi>) there ſhall not.</p>
            <p>And ſo leaving her alone, they went out. And <hi>Don Iuan</hi>
went unto the woman, and willed her to goe in, and that ſhee ſhould carry
in along with her the babe in its rich cloathes, if ſhe had put them on, the
woman told him that ſhe had, and that it was now dreſt juſt in the ſame
manner as he brought it thither. The woman came in, being adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed before
hand what ſhee ſhould anſwer unto that, which touching that creature, the
Lady which ſhe ſhould find there within ſhould aske her.</p>
            <p>As ſoone as <hi>Cornelia</hi> ſaw her, ſhe ſayd unto her;
welcome my friend; give mee I pray thee this pretty
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and bring hither this light,
ſhee did ſo. And <hi>Cornelia</hi> taking<pb n="75" facs="tcp:58406:41"/>the babe in
her armes, ſhee was mightily troubled, and looked very wiſſely and
ſteadily on it, and ſayd to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; tell me truly, this childe and that
which was brought me a little while ſince is it one and the ſame? yes
(Madam) anſwered the woman; how then comes it to paſſe that the Mantles
are thus changed? (replyed <hi>Cornelia.</hi>) Indeede (my friend) I conceive
eyther that theſe are other Mantles, or that this is not the ſame creature.
All this may very well be, ſayd the woman. Very well be, (ſayd
<hi>Cornelia</hi>) how may that be? O good woman how my heart doth beate and is
ready to breake through my breſt, and will never leave beating till I know
this change of cloathes. Tell me, I conjure thee (my friend) by all that which
thou loveſt beſt, by that which is neareſt and deareſt unto thee, tell
me I ſay, whence haſt thou theſe rich mantles? for I muſt let thee know
that they are mine if my ſight doe not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me, or my memory fayle me.
With theſe very ſame, or with others like unto them, I delivered my maid
the beloved pledge of my ſoule. Who tooke them away? (O wretched that I am!)
and who brought them hither? Ay me moſt unfortunate!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don luan</hi> and <hi>Don Antonio,</hi> who heard all theſe
complaints were not willing that ſhee ſhould proceede any further in them,
neither would they permit that the errour and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of changing the Mantles,
ſhould hold her in further paine and ſuſpence, and therefore they entred
in, and <hi>Don Iuan</hi> ſayd unto her.</p>
            <p>Theſe Mantles and this child <hi>(Lady Cornelia)</hi> are both
yours. And preſently point by point, he recounted unto her that he was the
man to whom the mayd had given the child; and how he brought him home to this
his houſe, and gave the woman order for the changing of the Mantles, and the
reaſon and occaſion why he did it. Howbeit, after that ſhee had
acquainted him with her delivery, he did certainly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure himſelfe that
it was her ſonne, and that if hee had not told her ſo before, it was
becauſe that her ſudaine<pb n="76" facs="tcp:58406:42"/>paſſion of being in doubt
of knowing him might bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced with the ſupervening joy of knowing
him.</p>
            <p>Thereupon, infinite were the teares of joy ſhed by
<hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelia,</hi> infinite the kiſſes which ſhee gave her ſonne, and
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite the thankes, which ſhee rendred to theſe Spaniſh Gentlemen, who
had done her theſe great favours, ſtyling them the humane Angels of her
guard, and giving them many other Titles which might give notorious
manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of her thankefulneſſe.</p>
            <p>They left her with their woman, recommending her unto her care,
charging her, that ſhe ſhould look well unto her, and as farre forth as was
poſſible ſerve her diligently, advertiſing her in what caſe ſhee
was, that ſhe might have recourſe for her remedy, ſince that ſhee in
regard that ſhee was a woman, knew better what belonged thereunto then they
did. And ſo that little that remained of night they went to take their
reſt, with intention not to enter into <hi>Cornelia's</hi> Chamber
unleſſe it were that eyther ſhee did call for them, or in caſe of
preciſe neceſſitie. The day came and the woman brought one very
ſecretly, and whileſt it was yet darke, for to give the child ſucke.</p>
            <p>When the gentlemen were up, they inquired after <hi>Cornelia;</hi>
the woman told them that ſhee was taking her reſt: whereupon they went to
the ſchooles and paſſed through that ſtreete where the quarrell was,
and by that houſe, from whence <hi>Cornelia</hi> came, for to ſee if her
fault or her being miſt were publique, or if there were any company gathered
together thereabouts. But by no meanes could they perceive, or heare any thing
neither of the fray, nor of <hi>Cornelia's</hi> abſence.</p>
            <p>This diligence done, having heard their Lectures they came home.
<hi>Cornelia</hi> called for them, and ſent their wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man unto them, to whom
they made anſwer, that they were reſolved, not to put their feete within
her Chamber, to the end that with the more <hi>decorum,</hi> that reſpect
ſhould be had, which was due to her modeſty, and honeſty. But 
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58406:42"/>ſhee replyed with teares and intreaties that they would
come and ſee her, for that was the moſt convenient <hi>deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> if
not for her remedy, yet at leaſt for her comfort. They did ſo, and ſhee
received them with a cheerefull countenance, and a great deale of courteſie;
intreating them that they would doe her the favour to goe into the Citie, and
ſee if they could heare any newes of her bold attempt. They told her, that
they had done this dilligence with all the curioſitie they could deviſe,
but not a word that was ſpoken of it.</p>
            <p>Whilſt they were talking of this buſineſſe, one of their
Pages (for they kept three) came to the Chamber doore, and from without,
ſayd; there is a gentleman at doore attended by two ſervants, who names
himſelfe <hi>Lorenzo Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivogli,</hi> and would faine ſpeake with my
Maſter <hi>Don Iuan de Gamboa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vpon the hearing of this meſſage, <hi>Cornelia</hi> clapt both
her hands upon her mouth, from betweene which came forth a low and fearefull
voyce, ſaying.</p>
            <p>My brother (Gentlemen) my brother, it is hee, it is hee;
doubtleſſe hee hath had notice of my being here, and is come purpoſely
hither to take away my life. Helpe mee (Gentlemen) good Gentlemen helpe mee,
ſuccour and protect a poore diſtreſſed Gentlewoman, and ſuffer her
not to be murthered in your preſence.</p>
            <p>Quiet your ſelfe Lady, (ſayd <hi>Don Antonio</hi>) content
your ſelfe and bee ſtill; for you are in ſuch a place, and in the power
of ſuch a one, who will not ſuffer any the leaſt wrong in the world to be
done unto you. Goe you forth <hi>(Don Iuan)</hi> and ſee what this gentleman
will have, and I will ſtay here to make good this place if neede ſhall
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, in the behalfe of <hi>Cornelia. Don Iuan</hi> without any alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
or change of countenance went downe; And <hi>Don Antonio</hi> cauſed
preſently a brace of piſtolls that were ready charged, to be brought him,
and commanded the Pages, that they ſhould take unto them their ſwords, and
be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared<pb n="78" facs="tcp:58406:43"/>to prevent any affront that ſhould bee
offred.</p>
            <p>The woman perceiving theſe preventions, trembled; And
<hi>Cornelia,</hi> fearefull of ſome ill ſucceſſe, ſhaked and
qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered much more. Onely <hi>Don Antonio</hi> and <hi>Don Iuan</hi> were
themſelves and very well appointed, and reſolved on that which they were to
doe.</p>
            <p>At the doore that opened to the ſtreete, <hi>Don Iuan</hi> found
<hi>Don Lorenzo,</hi> who had no ſooner ſeene <hi>Don Iuan,</hi> but hee
ſayd unto him; I beſeech you (Sir) (for this is the faſhion, and
courteſie of <hi>Italy</hi>) that you will doe mee the favour to goe along
with me to that Church, which is there right over againſt us; for I have a
buſineſſe to impart unto you, which imports no leſſe, then my life
and my honour. With a very good will replyed <hi>Don Iuan;</hi> Come (Sir) let
us goe whether you pleaſe. Having ſayd this, they walked hand in hand to
the Church, and ſitting downe on a forme, and in place apart, where they
might not bee heard, <hi>Lorenzo</hi> ſpake firſt and ſayd.</p>
            <p>I (noble <hi>Spaniard</hi>) am <hi>Lorenzo Bentivogli;</hi> if not
one of the richeſt, yet one of the chiefeſt of this City. This truth being
ſo notorious, may ſerve to excuſe this my ſpeaking in mine owne
praiſe, I have ſome yeares ſince continued an Orphane, and there remayned
in my power a ſiſter of mine, my onely ſiſter ſo fayre and ſo
beautifull, that were ſhee not ſo neare unto me I ſhould in ſuch lively
colours ſet it forth, that no indearing ſhould be wanting; for to tell you
truly there is not that beauty, take it altogether that can truly match it. Now
for that I am honorably deſcended, and ſhee young and faire, it made mee to
be very ſolicitous and carefull in the ſafe keeping of ſo rich a jewell.
But the headſtrong will of my ſiſter <hi>Cornelia</hi> (for that is her
name) hath defrauded all my preventions, and diligences. In a word, for to cut
of that (not to weary you) which would be too long a ſtory to tell, I ſhall
ſhut up all in this.</p>
            <p>That the Duke of <hi>Ferrara, Alfonſo de Eſte,</hi> with
<hi>Lynx</hi> his<pb n="79" facs="tcp:58406:43"/>eyes overcame thoſe of <hi>Argos,</hi>
overthrew my vigilancie and triumphed over my induſtry by ſubduing my
Siſter, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her away by night, and taking her out of our kinſwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
houſe, and (as they ſay) being but newly delivered, it was night ere I knew
it, and this very night I went to ſeek him out, and I thinke that I met with
him, and gave him ſomething that hee cannot brag of; but he was ſuccoured
by ſome Angel who would not give way that I ſhould waſh out the ſtaine
of my diſhonour with his blood. My kinſwoman told mee (for I had all this
from her) that the Duke had deceived my ſiſter under the promiſe of
taking her to be his wife. Which I believe not, by reaſon of the inequalitie
in the match in regard of the goods of fortune, though there bee no
diſparitie in thoſe of nature and of blood, ſince that the qualitie of
the <hi>Bentivogli</hi> of <hi>Bologna</hi> is well knowne to the world. That,
which I beleeve is, that the Duke (as all great and powerfull perſons uſe
to doe, who ſeeke to tread under their feete the honour of a ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous and
wary Damſell) ſetting before her eyes the ſweet name of husband, making
her beleeve that for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine reſpects hee could not with conveniencie
preſently marry her; lies carrying appearance of truths, but falſe, and ill
intended. But be it what it will be, I am ſure I ſee my ſelfe without a
ſiſter and without mine honour; though all this untill now I have lockt up
in my boſome, under the key of ſilence, and was not willing to make any
acquainted with this my wrong, till I could ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I could be able to
remedy it, or in ſome ſort receive ſatisfation. For it is better that
infamies be preſumed and ſuſpected then that they ſhould be certainly
and diſtinctly knowne; for betwixt the yea and nay, the affirmation and
negation of a doubt, every one may leane and incline to that part, which he
beſt liketh, and every one ſhall have them abettors.</p>
            <p>In concluſion I reſolved to goe to <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and to
require of the Duke himſelfe ſatisfaction of my affront, and if hee 
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:58406:44"/>ſhall deny it me, to defie him, and challenge him the
field upon the caſe now in hand, but this not to be performed by ſquadrons
and troopes of men, for theſe, I can neither make nor maintaine, but man to
man. In which buſineſſe I would crave the aſſiſtance of your
perſon, and that you would be pleaſed to accompany mee in this my journey,
being confident of your ſufficiencie and good perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance in what you
undertake, for that you are a <hi>Spaniard</hi> and a Gentleman as I have
already beene informed. Nor am I willing to acquaint therewith any kinſeman
or friend of mine, from whom I expect nothing but counſailes and
diſwaſions, and from you I may expect thoſe that are good and honorable,
though they breake through any dangers and difficulties whatſoever. You (Sir)
I muſt intreate to doe me the favour to goe along with mee, for having a
<hi>Spaniard</hi> by my ſide, and ſuch a one, as you ſeeme unto me to be
I ſhall make account that I carry with me in my defence the Armies of
<hi>Xerxes.</hi> It is a great courteſie that I crave of you, but the debt of
correſponding with that which fame proclaymeth of your nation obliegeth you
to much more.</p>
            <p>No more <hi>(Senior Lorenzo)</hi> at this time ſaid <hi>Don
Iuan</hi> (for hitherto without interrupting you, I have hearkned to every word
of yours) no more I ſay; for henceforth I conſtitute my ſelfe your
defender and adviſer, and take to my charge either ſatisfaction or revenge
of your wrong. And this not onely as I am a <hi>Spanyard,</hi> but as I am a
gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and that you are ſo principall a perſon as you have voiced your
ſelfe to be and as I my ſelfe and all the world knowes.</p>
            <p>Now (Sir) it remaineth, that you reſolve upon the time of our
going hence. And as I conceive the ſooner the better for the Iron is to bee
wrought whileſt it is hot, and the heate of choller doth increaſe courage,
and an injury whilſt it is froſh doth rouze and ſtirre up revenge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lorenzo</hi> roſe up from the forme whereon hee ſate, and 
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:58406:44"/>with cloſe imbracements claſpt <hi>Don Iuan</hi> in his
armes, and ſayd; having ſo generous a breſt as yours is <hi>(Senor Don
Iuan)</hi> it is needleſſe to move it, by ſetting before it any other
inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt then that of that honour, which you ſhall gaine in this action,
the which ſhall be wholly yours, in caſe we come off happily with this
buſineſſe. And for an addition, I offer unto you all whatſoever I have,
hold or poſſeſſe, as farre as I am or can bee able. And if you like of
it, I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly that wee ſhould take our journey to morrow mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
for I ſhall be able to day to provide all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for it.</p>
            <p>I like very well of it (replyed <hi>Don Iuan;</hi>) But I pray
give me leave <hi>(Senor Lorenzo)</hi> that I acquaint therewith a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
my companion and friend of whoſe valour and ſilence you may be bolder to
build upon then on mine.</p>
            <p>Since that you <hi>(Senior Don Iuan)</hi> have (as you ſay)
taken my honour to your charge, diſpoſe thereof as you pleaſe and ſpeak
thereof what you will, and to whom you will; how much more to your companion
and friend, who be he what he will bee, being of your choyce, cannot chooſe
but be good.</p>
            <p>This ſaid, they imbraced each other, and tooke their leave,
<hi>Signor Lorenzo</hi> telling him, that he would ſend one unto him the next
morning to call him, and that they would take horſe without the Citie, and
goe on their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended journey in ſome diſguiſe, that there might no
notice be taken of them. <hi>Don Iuan</hi> came home, and gave an account to
<hi>Don Antonio</hi> and <hi>Cornelia</hi> of that which had paſſed with
<hi>Lorenzo,</hi> and the agreement made betweene them.</p>
            <p>Lord bleſſe me (ſaid <hi>Cornelia</hi>) great (Sir) is your
courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and as great your confidence. How, and ſo ſuddain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have you
put your ſelfe into a buſineſſe ſo full of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences? And how
do you know (Sir) whether my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will carry you to <hi>Ferrara,</hi> or
ſome other place? But whither ſoever hee ſhall carry you, you may
aſſure your ſelfe, that there goes along with you faithfulneſſe 
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:58406:45"/>it ſelfe though my ſelfe (I confeſſe) as a wretched
and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate woman doe ſtumble at the motes of the Sunne, and am afrayd
of overy ſhadow; and can you blame mee for being afrayd, ſince that my life
or my death dependeth on the Dukes anſwer? And what doe I know whether or no
hee will anſwer ſo temperately that my brothers choller may containe it
ſelfe within the bounds and limits of his diſcretion? And ſay it ſhould
breake out, doe you thinke that he is to deale with a weake enemy? And doe not
you likewiſe thinke that all the while that you ſhall be abſent I ſhall
remaine hanging betwixt heaven and hell, fearefull and ſuſpenſefull,
expecting the ſweete or bitter newes of the ſucceſſe of this
buſineſſe? Doe I love ſo little either the Duke or my brother, that I
doe not dread the diſgrace and misfortunes of them both, and feele the
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of them in my very ſoule? You diſcourſe much and feare more,
(Lady <hi>Cornelia</hi>) ſaid <hi>Don Iuan.</hi> But let me perſwade you
amongſt ſo many feares, to leave ſome place for hope. Put your truſt in
God, in my induſtrie and good deſires, &amp; I doubt not, but you ſhall
ſee yours fulfilled with all felicitie and happineſſe. Our going to
<hi>Ferrara</hi> is not to be excuſed, &amp; as little my deſiſting to
aſſiſt your brother; as yet wee doe notknow the Dukes intention, &amp; as
little whether he know that you be miſſing. And all this we muſt know
from his owne mouth, &amp; no man can better put this queſtion unto him then
my ſelfe And (Lady <hi>Cornelia</hi>) I would have you to know, that the
welfare and content of your brother &amp; the Duke, I have placed in the apples
of mine eyes, and will be as carefull of them as I am of theſe. Heaven
proſper you <hi>(Senior Don Iuan)</hi> replyed <hi>Cornelia,</hi> and give
you the power to bring this buſineſſe to a good iſſue, and me a
thankfull ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment for the good comfort I receive from you. In the
midſt of theſe my troubles (thanks to your goodnes) I hold my ſelfe very
fortunate. Now however feare may afflict me in your abſence, or hope hold me
in ſuſpence, me thinkes I would faine ſee you gone, and as faine ſee
you quickly returne.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:58406:45"/>
               <hi>Don Antonio</hi> approved the
determination of <hi>Don Iuan,</hi> and commended the good correſpondence
which <hi>Lorenzo Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivogli's</hi> confidence had found in him. Morecover hee
told him that hee would goe to accompanie them, in regard of that which might
happen, not knowing whether things would bee fairey carried, and ſo for feare
of the worſt would be ready (if occaſion ſerved) to ſee how the game
went, and to prevent all foule play.</p>
            <p>O by no meanes (ſaid <hi>Don Iuan</hi>) as well becauſe it is
not meete that the Lady <hi>Cornelia</hi> ſhould be left alone, as alſo
that <hi>Signor Lorenzo</hi> may not thinke that I would, (as if I wanted true
valour,) underprop mine owne weakeneſſe, with the ſtrength of others.
What concernes you concernes mee (anſwered <hi>Don Antonio;</hi>) and
therefore though unknowne, and keeping aloofe off, I meane to follow you, and I
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume my Lady <hi>Cornelia</hi> will bee well pleaſed therewith. Neither
will ſhee remaine ſo all alone, that ſhee ſhall want one to ſerve,
attend, and keepe her company.</p>
            <p>Whereunto <hi>Cornelia</hi> anſwered, it will be a great comfort
to me (gentlemen) that yee goe both together, or at leaſt in ſuch ſort,
that (if need ſhould require) you may ayde and helpe each other; and ſince
that (to my ſeeming) you goe upon a peece of ſervice which may be ſubject
to much perill and danger, doe me the favour (Gentlemen) to carry theſe
reliques along with you: and ſhee had no ſooner ſaid ſo, but ſhee
tooke from out her boſome a Croſſe of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds of ineſtimable valew,
and an <hi>Agnus Dei.</hi> They looked both of them on theſe rich Iewells,
and did valew them in more then they had the hatband. But they returned them
backe againe unto her, ſaying; That they did carrie reliques with them,
though not ſo well ſet forth, and rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adorned, yet at leaſt as good
in their qualitie. <hi>Cornelia</hi> was very ſorry that they would not
accept of them, but in fine ſhee muſt doe as they would have her.</p>
            <p>The woman tooke great care and paines in tending and cheering up
<hi>Cornelia,</hi> and knowing the departure of her<pb n="84" facs="tcp:58406:46"/>maſters, for they had acquainted her therewith, but not what they
went about, nor whither they went, ſhe tooke it to her charge to looke well
unto the Lady, (whoſe name as yet ſhee did not know) ſo that they might
not at their returne have any juſt cauſe to finde fault.</p>
            <p>The next day betimes in the morning <hi>Lorenzo</hi> came to the
doore, and found <hi>Don Iuan</hi> ready for his journey, in a handſome
riding ſuite, his rich hat making ſomewhat the more gracefull ſhow by
reaſon of its intermingled blacke and yellow feathers, but the hatband hee
covered it over with a blacke vaile. Hee tooke his leave of <hi>Cornelia,</hi>
who imagining that her brother was now very neare her, was ſo afraid, that
ſhe had not the power to ſpeake one word to theſe two gentlemen that
tooke their leave of her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Iuan</hi> went forth firſt, and with <hi>Lorenzo</hi>
walked out of the Citie, and in a garden ſomewhat out of the rode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, they
found two very good Horſes well fitted, and two Lackeyes holding of them.
They mounted on them, the Lackeyes running before them, and by uncouth paths,
and untrodden by-wayes they travailed towards <hi>Ferrara.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Antonio</hi> upon a good quat-Nag of his owne, and in
another different riding ſuite, diſguiſing himſelfe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after
them, but it ſeemed unto him, that they had an eye upon him, eſpecially
<hi>Lorenzo,</hi> and therefore reſolved to take the direct way to
<hi>Ferrara,</hi> aſſuring himſelf that there he ſhould meete with
them.</p>
            <p>They had ſcarce gone out of the Citie, but that
<hi>Cornelia</hi> gave an account to the woman of all that had befallen her,
and how that child was hers, begotten on her by the Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi>
with all the points and paſſages which hitherto have beene related touching
her ſtorie, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing from her how that journey which her maſters had
undertaken was for <hi>Ferrara,</hi> accompanying her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who went to bid
defiance by way of challenge to the Duke <hi>Alſonſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>
               </hi> Which the woman hearing, ſaid unto her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:58406:46"/>O ſweete Lady, hath all this adoe beene
about you, and doe you like one that ſleepes without ſtretched leggs ſtay
here thus careleſſe in a buſineſſe of ſuch conſequence? Fither
have you no ſoule, or have you it ſo benummed and ſo ſenceleſſe
that you have no feeling of the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eſtate and condition wherein you
are? And I pray tell mee, doe you happily thinke that your brother goes to
<hi>Ferrara?</hi> Deceive not your ſelfe, doe not thinke ſo, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thinke and beleeve that hee hath taken my maſters hence, and to get them
farre from home, that hee may the ſafelier returne hither and take away your
life; which he may as eaſily doe, as I take up this cup and drinke.
Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with your ſelfe under what guard and protection wee remaine. We
have no more but three Pages in the houſe, and they have enough to doe to
ſcratch their itching ſcabbes, whereof they are full; and ſay they
ſhould put themſelves upon upon defence, what can they doe? This at leaſt
I can ſay of my ſelfe, that I (for my part) have not the heart to ſtay
expecting the ſucceſſe and ruine which threatens this houſe.
<hi>Signior Lorenzo,</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> and truſt <hi>Spanyards?</hi>
Hee crave their helpe and aſſiſtance? beleeve it he that liſt, for I
doe not; Hee reckon of them? hee cares not a Figge for them. If you (daughter
mine) will take my counſell, I will give you that that ſhall make you ſee
a little better if you will not ſtand in your owne light.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cornelia</hi> hearing the womans reaſons which ſhee
uttered with ſuch earneſtneſſe and vehemencie, and with ſuch ſhowes
and manifeſtations of feare, that all that ſhee ſaid unto her ſeemed to
bee truths, and that peradventure <hi>Don Iuan</hi> and <hi>Don Antonio</hi>
might bee ſlaine, and that her brother might bee entring the doores of the
houſe, and with his dagger never leave ſtabbing of her til he had killed
her; and therefore being thus perplexed, ſhee ſaid unto her; And what
counſell will you give mee (friend) that might be wholeſome, and that might
prevent this ſtorme that hangs over our heads?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:58406:47"/>What counſell will I give you? Marry ſuch
and ſo good that all the world (ſayd the woman) cannot better it. I did
once (Madam) ſerve an honeſt Curate of a countrie Village, which is ſome
two miles off from <hi>Ferrara;</hi> hee is a good man and will doe any thing
for mee that I can aske of him or is in his power to performe. Hee loves me
well, and is more oblieged unto mee, then to any other woman whatſoever. Let
us goe thither and let mee alone to get ſome one or other that ſhall carry
us thither. And as for her that gives the child ſuck, ſhee is a poore
woman, and will goe along with us to the worlds end. And admit (Lady) that you
ſhould bee found out, it were better that you ſhould be found in the
houſe of a Prieſt, and that is an old and reverend man, then in the power
of two young Students and thoſe <hi>Spanyards,</hi> who are a kind of people
(as I my ſelfe can well witneſſe) that will flie at any game. If they
cannot meete with a handſome peece of Timber they will content themſelves
with Chips, and if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not light upon a ſmooth poliſhed ſtone, they
will make uſe of rubbiſh. And though now (Lady) that you are ill at eaſe,
they have borne you good reſpect, yet when you ſhall be well and in perfect
health, then heaven have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon you. There is no other helpe that I know.
And that I may not lie unto you, if my repulſes, diſdaines and integritie
had not guarded me, they had given check mate to my honeſtie; all is not gold
(Lady) that gliſters in them. They ſay one thing and thinke another, I have
had try all enough of them, yet they were not ſo cunning but I was as
craftie. Every body knowes where his owne ſhooe wrings him moſt. I am
Madam, (may I ſpeake it without boaſting) well borne; I come of the
(<hi>ribelos</hi> of <hi>Milan,</hi> and for point of honour that I hold in
ſo good a height, that I make account that it reacheth hence ten miles above
the clouds. And yet notwithſtanding all this, you may ſee the calamities
and croſſes (Madam) which I have paſt through, ſince that being
deſcended as I am, I am come to<pb n="87" facs="tcp:58406:47"/>be a ſervant and drudge
to theſe <hi>Spanyards</hi> whom they call their woman. Though indeede I
muſt confeſſe that I have no great cauſe to complaine of my maſters,
for they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kinde and loving, ſo long as you doe not croſſe and
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger them. And herein they ſeeme to be Biskayners, as they report
themſelves to bee. But it may be that they are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to themſelves, that
they are <hi>Gallegos,</hi> which is another nation they ſay leſſe
punctuall, and ſomewhat more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till and wary then the Biskayners.</p>
            <p>In concluſion, ſhee rendred ſuch and ſuch reaſons, that
poore <hi>Cornelia</hi> diſpoſed her ſelfe to follow her adviſe; and
ſo in leſſe then foure houres, ſhee diſpoſing the buſineſſe
and <hi>Cornelia</hi> conſenting thereunto they had both of them got them
into a Waggon, together with the childs nurſe, and without being heard of the
Pages they put themſelves upon their way for that Village where the Curate
dwelt. And all this was done by the perſwaſion of this fooliſh, fearefull
woman, and with her moneys, for not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her maſter had paid her a
whole yeares wages. And therefore there was no neede of pawning a jewell which
<hi>Cornelia</hi> gave her for that purpoſe. And for that <hi>Cornelia</hi>
had heard <hi>Don Iuan</hi> ſay that he and her brother would not goe the
direct way to <hi>Ferrara,</hi> but by unuſed paths, they were willing to
take the direct way going on very leyſurely, that they might not meete with
them; and the Waggoner did apply himſelfe to their will, and paced on
according to their minde, becauſe they had contented and payd him according
to his. But let us leave them jogging on their journey, with that (how e're it
hap) their bold adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>And now let us ſee how it fared with <hi>Don Iuan de
Gamboa,</hi> and <hi>Signor Lorenzo di Bentivogli,</hi> of whom it is ſayd,
that being upon their way, they had notice that the Duke was not in
<hi>Ferrara</hi> but in <hi>Bologna.</hi> And therefore leaving the wheeling
and going about which they had fetche, they came into the common high-way,
conſidering with themſelves that the<pb n="88" facs="tcp:58406:48"/>Duke muſt
paſſe that way in his returne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>om <hi>Bologna</hi> And they had not long beene enered thereinto,
when looking towards <hi>Bologna</hi> for to ſee if any came from thence,
they might eſpie comming towards them a great troope of Horſe; And then
<hi>Don Iuan</hi> ſaid to <hi>Lorenzo</hi> that hee ſhould goe a little out
of the way becauſe if it ſhould happen that the Duke ſhould come in
company with them hee would have ſome ſpeech there with him, before hee
ſhould enter into <hi>Ferrara,</hi> which was not farre off. <hi>Lorenzo</hi>
did ſo, and approved <hi>Don Iuans</hi> opinion.</p>
            <p>As ſoone as <hi>Lorenzo</hi> was gone aſide, <hi>Don Iuan</hi>
tooke off that caſe which covered his rich hatband, and this he did not
without diſereete diſcourſe, as he afterwards declared. By this time this
travayling troope was come, and among them came a woman upon a pide Nagge in a
faire riding ſuite, and her face covered with a Maske, either for the better
keeping of her ſelfe from being knowne, or for to keepe her ſelfe from the
Sunne and Ayre.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Iuan</hi> ſtood ſtill with his horſe in the middle
of the way, and bare faced, wayting till this troope ſhould come up to him.
And in comming nearer up unto him, his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, his lively and ſpritefull
looke, his pleaſing counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, the galantrie of his cloathes, and the
proudneſſe of his Horſe, and the glittering luſter and bright-ſhining
beames of his Diamonds, drew after them the eyes of all thoſe that paſt
that way; and more eſpecially thoſe of the Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> who
was one of them; who as ſoone as he had placed his eyes on the hatband, he
preſently appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended that he who wore it, was <hi>Don Iuan de Gamboa,</hi>
who had taken part with him, and brought him ſafe off in that his quarrell.
And ſo truly did he apprehend this truth, that without making further
diſcourſe with himſelfe, hee ſet Spurre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to his Horſe, and made up to <hi>Don Iuan,</hi> ſaying; No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Sir. If I call you <hi>Don Iuan de Gamboa,</hi> I perſwade my ſelfe I
ſhall not be therein deceived, for your brave and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle diſpoſition,
and this hat you weare tells me as much.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:58406:48"/>It is true (anſwered <hi>Don Iuan</hi>) for
I never yet knew nor am I willing to diſſemble, or conceale my name, for I
have not done ought that I need to be aſhamed thereof. But I pray (Sir) tell
me who you are, leaſt I might otherwiſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend in point of good manners,
and ſo ſhow my ſelfe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courteous.</p>
            <p>That is impoſſible (replyed the Duke) for I concerve and
aſſure you on my part, that you can in no caſe bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courteous with
me, yet notwithſtanding I tell you <hi>Senior Don Iuan</hi> that I am the
Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and he that is oblie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſerve you all the dayes
of his life; for it is not foure nights ſince that you gave it me. The Duke
had no ſooner made an end of ſaying this, but <hi>Don Iuan</hi> with
ſtrange nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe alighted from his horſe &amp; went to kiſſe
the Dukes foote. But for all the haſte that he made, the Duke had got downe
from his ſeate, and tooke <hi>Don Iuan</hi> and imbraced him in his armes.
<hi>Signor Lorenzo</hi> who from far beheld theſe ceremonies, not thinking
that they were of courteſie but of choler put ſpurs to his horſe as hard
as hee could drive but in the midſt of his ſpeede, hee tooke him up gently
by degrees, and made a ſtand, becauſe he ſaw the Duke, and <hi>Don
Iuan</hi> (who now knew the Duke) cloſely imbracing one another, and the Duke
caſting his eye over <hi>Don Iuans</hi> ſhoulder hee eſpied
<hi>Lorenzo,</hi> and knew him, and was at the firſt ſight, not dreaming of
his being there ſo neare him, ſomewhat ſtartled therewith, and therefore
whileſt they were as yet in their imbracements, the Duke demanded of <hi>Don
Iuan</hi> whether <hi>Lorenzo Bentivogli,</hi> who ſtood there by, came along
with him or no? Whereunto <hi>Don Iuan</hi> replyed; Let us goe a little
aſide, and I ſhall acquaint your Excellencie with great and ſtrange
mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. The Duke did ſo, and then <hi>Don Iuan</hi> ſayd unto him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Signor Lorenzo Bentivogli,</hi> whom you ſee there, hath a
complaint, and no ſmall one againſt you; Hee ſaith, that it is now foure
nights ſince that you tooke his Siſter <hi>Cornelia</hi> out of his
Kinſwomans houſe, and that you<pb n="90" facs="tcp:58406:49"/>have deceived and
diſhonoured her, and hee would know from you what ſatisfaction you meane to
give him by way of reparation, which hee holds fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. Hee intreated
mee that I would bee his ſecond, or at leaſt become an Vmpire, for the
according of this buſineſſe, upon honorable tearmes. I offered this my
ſervice and my beſt indeavours, becauſe by thoſe gueſſes and
ſuſpitions which hee gave me of the quarrell, I knew that you (Sir) were
the maſter and owner of this hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band which out of your liberalitie and
courteſie, you would that it ſhould bee mine. And knowing like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that
none could better undertake this taske then my ſelfe, nor more tender your
good and ſafetie then I doe, I offered him my beſt furtherance and
aſſiſtance. Now that (Sir) which I would intreate of you, is, that you
would plainely tell mee what you know concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this caſe, and whether that
bee true which <hi>Lorenzo</hi> ſaith.</p>
            <p>O my deare friend, (anſwered the Duke) it is ſuch a truth that
I dare not, though I would deny it: But I muſt tell you withall, that I have
neither deceived, nor taken <hi>Cornelia</hi> away, though I know ſhee is
gone out of the houſe where ſhe was, but whither God knowes, for I doe not.
I have not deceived her, becauſe I hold her to bee my wife; nor have I taken
her away becauſe I know not what is become of her. And if I did not
publiquely ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate my Nuptialls, it was becauſe I did ſtill looke that
my mother (who is now upon her laſt) ſhould paſſe from this to a better
life, being very deſirous that I ſhould mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Lady <hi>Livia,</hi>
daughter to the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> as likewiſe for many other
inconveniences, more perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture effectuall then the former, and not now fit
to bee ſpoken of. That which paſſeth (and take it for truth) is; That
that very night, when you came in to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour mee, I purpoſed to have
carryed her away with mee to <hi>Ferrara.</hi> For ſhee was now in the moneth
wherein<pb n="91" facs="tcp:58406:49"/>ſhee was to bring forth to the light that pledge
which heaven had ordained to be depoſited in her. Now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were by
reaſon of that quarrell, or whether by my careleſſenes, when I came to
her houſe I found comming out of it, the ſecretary of our compact and
contract, and all other our meetings and agreements. I ask't for
<hi>Cornelia,</hi> ſhee told mee that ſhee was newly gone out, and that
ſhee had that very night beene delivered of a ſonne, one of the fayreſt
creatures that ever eye ſaw, and that ſhee had given it to my ſervant
<hi>Fabio.</hi> That is the damſell which comes there, <hi>Fabio</hi> is here
with mee, but the babe and <hi>Cornelia</hi> are both miſſing. I have beene
there two dayes in <hi>Bologna,</hi> expecting and inquiring if I could heare
any newes of <hi>Cornelia,</hi> but have heard none.</p>
            <p>So that (Sir ſaid <hi>Don Iuan,</hi> when <hi>Cornelia</hi> and
your ſonne ſhall appeare you will neither deny the one to bee your
ſpouſe, nor the other your ſonne.</p>
            <p>No certainly, (replyed the Duke) for though I prize my my ſelfe
to be a gentleman, yet I priſe my ſelfe more, to be a Chriſtian. And the
rather for that <hi>Cornelia</hi> is ſuch a one, as deſerveth to be
miſtreſſe of a kingdome, ſhould ſhee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare and live or my mother
die, the world ſhall then know that if I knew to be a lover, I likewiſe
knew how to keepe that faith in publicke, which I did plight in ſecret.</p>
            <p>You ſhall doe well (Sir) ſaid <hi>Don Iuan;</hi> that what you
have ſaid to me you will ſay the ſame to your brother <hi>Signor
Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo.</hi> I am ſorie (replyed the Duke) that he hath beene kept ſo
long from knowing it.</p>
            <p>Thereupon <hi>Don Iuan</hi> inſtantly made ſignes to
<hi>Lorenzo</hi> that he ſhould alight from his horſe, and come unto them,
w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he did, being far from thinking on that good newes which attended him.
The Duke advanced himſelfe, to receive him with open armes, &amp; the firſt
word he ſpake unto him was <hi>(Brother.) Lorenzo</hi> ſcarce knew on the
ſodaine how to returne anſwer to ſo loving a ſalutation and courteous a
reception.<pb n="92" facs="tcp:58406:50"/>And ſtanding thus in ſuſpence before hee
could recollect himſelfe to ſpeake a word. <hi>Don Iuan</hi> ſaid unto
him.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>(Signior Lorenzo)</hi> acknowledgeth the ſecret
converſation which he hath had with your Siſter, the Lady
<hi>Cornelia.</hi> He likewiſe confeſſeth that ſhe is his lawfull wife;
and that as he avers it here, ſo will he avouch it in publicke when
occaſion ſhall be offered. He grants in like manner that hee went ſome
foure nights ſince to fetch her away from her kinſwomans houſe, for to
carrie her with him to <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and to waite for a good conjuncture
for the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrating of his Nuptials, which hee hath deferred upon very juſt
cauſes, which he hath made knowne unto mee; hee tells mee alſo of the
quarrell which he had with you; and that when he went for <hi>Cornelia,</hi>
hee met with <hi>Supicia,</hi> her wayting gentlewoman, which is that woman
whom you ſee there, of whom hee learned that it was not above an houre
ſince that <hi>Cornelia</hi> was delivered, and that ſhee gave the babe to
a ſervant of the Dukes, and that <hi>Cornelia</hi> forth with beleeving that
the Duke was there, went full of feare out of the houſe, becauſe ſhee
imagined, that you <hi>Signor Lorenzo,</hi> had already notice of her
proceedings. <hi>Sulpicia</hi> gave not the babe to the Dukes ſervant but to
another in his ſtead. <hi>Cornelia</hi> appeares not, the Duke beares all the
blame, and yet hee ſayth; That whenſoever and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Lady
<hi>Cornelia</hi> ſhall appeare, he will take and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive her as his true
and lawfull wife. Now <hi>(Signior Lorenzo)</hi> what can hee ſay more, or
what more by you, and us to bee deſired or wiſhed for, then the finding out
of thoſe two, as rich, as unfortunate pledges?</p>
            <p>Hereunto anſwered <hi>Signor Lorenzo</hi> (throwing himſelfe
at the Dukes feete, who ſtrove to take him up) Of your chriſtianitie and
greatneſſe (moſt noble Sir) and my deare brother, neither could my
Siſter nor my ſelfe expect leſſe good from you, then that which you
have done to us both. To her in equalling her with your ſelfe, and to me in
ranking me in the number of your friends and alliance.<pb n="93" facs="tcp:58406:50"/>And
with that the teares trickled downe from his eyes, and ſo likewiſe did they
from the Dukes, both out of meere tenderneſſe of heart. The one for the
loſſe of his ſpouſe, and the other that he had found ſo good a
brother in Law. But conſidering that it might ſeeme weakeneſſe in them
to manifeſt their griefe by their teares, they did compreſſe them, and
withdrew them from their eyes. But thoſe of <hi>Don Iuan</hi> were very
cheerefull, as if they had asked them <hi>Albricia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> or ſome reward for the glad tidings of
<hi>Cornelias</hi> and her ſonnes being found, being that he left them well
in his owne houſe.</p>
            <p>In theſe tearmes things ſtood, when loe <hi>Don Antonio de
Yſunca</hi> diſcovered himſelfe, whom whiles hee was yet a good wayes of,
<hi>Don Iuan</hi> knew by his Nagge, but when he drew neare he made a ſtand,
and ſaw <hi>Don Iuans</hi> and <hi>Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Lorenzoes</hi> horſes, and the
Lackeyes that held them, and though they were a good way off, yet he knew
<hi>Don Iuan</hi> and <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> but not the Duke. Hee knew not what to
doe with himſelfe, whether he ſhould draw neare or no, where <hi>Don
Iuan</hi> was: Comming therefore to one of the Dukes ſervants, he demanded of
him whether hee knew that gentleman which was with the other two, pointing to
the Duke? Hee told him that it was the Duke of <hi>Ferrara;</hi> wherewith he
remained amazed, and knew leſſe what to doe with himſelfe now then hee
did before. But <hi>Don Iuan</hi> did put him out of this his perplexitie by
calling unto him by his name. <hi>Don Antonio</hi> alighted, ſeeing that they
were all a foote, and came unto them. The Duke recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him with a great deale
of courteſie, becauſe <hi>Don Iuan</hi> had told him that hee was his
friend, and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            <p>In concluſion <hi>Don Iuan</hi> recounted unto <hi>Don
Antonio</hi> all that which had betided him with the Duke, till hee came unto
them. <hi>Don Antonio</hi> was therewith extreamely joyed, and ſaid to
<hi>Don Iuan;</hi> Why <hi>Senior Don Iuan</hi> doe not you make an end of
putting the joy and contentment of theſe<pb n="94" facs="tcp:58406:51"/>two gentlemen in
their true point, giving a period thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, by craving <hi>Albricias</hi> for
the finding out of the Lady <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelia,</hi> and her ſonne? If you had not
come <hi>(Senior Don Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio)</hi> I would have begd <hi>Albricias,</hi> but
now doe you begge them; for I aſſure you they will give them you with a
ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good will.</p>
            <p>I he Duke and <hi>Lorenzo</hi> hearing them treate of the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of <hi>Cornelia,</hi> and of <hi>Albricias,</hi> asked them what was that they
talked of? What ſhould it be (replyed <hi>Don Antonio</hi>) but that I am
willing to make one in this Tragick-Comedie, and muſt bee hee that muſt
begge <hi>Albricias</hi> of you for the finding of the Lady <hi>Cornelia,</hi>
and of her ſonne, for they are in my houſe. And ſo preſently point by
point hee recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto them all that which heretofore hath beene ſaid;
where of the Duke and <hi>Signor Lorenzo</hi> received ſo great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
and content, that <hi>Lorenzo</hi> imbraced <hi>Don Iuan,</hi> and the Duke
<hi>Don Antonio.</hi> The Duke promiſed all his eſtate for bringing him
this good newes, and <hi>Signor Lorenzo</hi> his goods, his life, and his
ſoule. They called to the wayting gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman that delivered the child to
<hi>Don Iuan,</hi> who having taken notice of <hi>Lorenzo</hi> ſtood
trembling and quaking for feare. They asked her if ſhee knew the man, to whom
ſhee had delivered the child, ſhee anſwered no; but that ſhee asked
him, if he were <hi>Fabio?</hi> And he replyed, yes, and that upon this good
beliefe ſhee gave it him, you ſay true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede (ſaid <hi>Don Iuan</hi>)
and you (gentlewoman) anon after ſhut the doore and told me that I ſhould
have a care of it, and ſee it ſafe, and come quickly backe againe unto you:
it is even ſo (Sir) as you ſay, anſwered the gentlewoman, ſhedding many
a teare. But the Duke bid her bee quiet, and ſaid; Now there are no neede
here of teares, but <hi>Iubiles,</hi> and feaſtings. And ſince the caſe
ſtands thus, I will not onter <hi>Ferrara,</hi> but forthwith returne backe
to <hi>Bologna;</hi> for all theſe contentments are but as in ſhadow, till
that the ſeeing of my <hi>Cornelia</hi> make them true. And without ſaying
any more, by a joynt conſent they preſently turned about to make for
<hi>Bologna.</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:58406:51"/>
               <hi>Don Antonio</hi> went before for to
prepare for <hi>Cornelia,</hi> leaſt that ſhee might be overtaken with
ſome ſuddaine paſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the unexpected comming of the Duke, and her
bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But when hee found her not, neither could the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges tell him any
newes of her, he remained the moſt aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and moſt ſorrowfull man in
the world. And when he ſaw that their woman too was wanting, he imagined that
by her induſtry and perſwaſions <hi>Cornelia</hi> was miſſing. The
Pages told him that the woman was wanting the ſame day that they were. And as
for <hi>Cornelia,</hi> for whom he asked, they never ſaw her. <hi>Don
Antonio</hi> was almoſt out of his wits with this unexpected chance, fearing
happily that the Duke would hold them for lyars or impoſtors, or perhaps
imagine other worſer things, which might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound in prejudice of their
honour, and <hi>Cornelia's</hi> cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit.</p>
            <p>Whilſt he was imagining and caſting theſe doubts and
ſcruples with himſelfe, entred the Duke, <hi>Don Iuan,</hi> and
<hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo</hi> by unfrequented ſtreets and backe lanes, having left the
reſt of their people without the Citie. They came to <hi>Don Iuans</hi>
houſe, and found <hi>Don Antonio</hi> ſitting in a Chayre, with his hands
on his cheekes, and with a colour as pale and wanne as death. <hi>Don Iuan</hi>
asked him, what are you not well? Where is <hi>Cornelia? Don Antonio</hi>
replyed; How can I be well, ſince that <hi>Cornelia</hi> doth not appeare?
who with the woman that we left with her for to keepe her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, the ſame
day that we were gone, ſhe was gone. The Duke wanted little of growing
deſperate upon the hearing of this ſad newes.</p>
            <p>In a word, all of them were much troubled, ſuſpenſive, and
imaginative, caſting I know not what in their mindes. Whilſt they were thus
in their dumpes, there came a Page unto <hi>Don Antonio,</hi> and whiſpering
him in the care, told him; <hi>Santiſtevan, Don Iuans</hi> Page, from that
day that you went hence, hath kept a very handſome woman in his chamber and I
beleeve that her name is <hi>Cornelia,</hi> for I heard him call 
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:58406:52"/>her ſo. <hi>Antonio</hi> was now troubled anew, and would
ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that <hi>Cornelia</hi> had not appeared at all (for hee did verily
beleeve that that was ſhee whom the Page had hid) then that they ſhould
finde her in ſuch a place, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he ſayd nothing, but
holding his peace hee ſtole to the Pages Chamber but found the doore lockt,
and the Page from home. Hee came to the doore, and in a low voyce ſaid; Lady
<hi>Cornelia</hi> open the doore, come forth to receive your brother and the
Duke your husband, who are come to ſeeke you. He heard one anſwer within;
what doe you mocke me? I am not ſo ill favored, nor ſo unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate that
Dukes and Earles may not ſeeke after mee. But this it is, to have to doe with
Pages, I deſerve no better payment. By which words <hi>Don Antonio</hi>
underſtood that ſhee that anſwered him was not <hi>Cornelia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilſt this paſſed, came <hi>Santiſtevan</hi> the Page,
and hyed him preſently to his lodging, and finding <hi>Don Antonio</hi> there
who willed him to bring him the Keyes of the houſe, for to try if any of them
would open the doore; the Page fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling downe upon his knees, with the Key in
his hand, ſaid unto him; your abſence and my roguery made me bring hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this woman, who hath abode with me here, this three nights; I beſeech you
(Sir) as you are a gentleman, and may heare good newes from <hi>Spaine,</hi>
that if my maſter <hi>Don Iuan de Gamboa</hi> hath not already heard of it,
that he may not know of it, for I will inſtantly put her out of the houſe.
And what is this womans name, ſayd <hi>Don Antonio</hi> her name Sir (replyed
the Page) is <hi>Cornelia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Page who diſcovered the Ambuſh, (who bare no great good
will to <hi>Santiſtevan,</hi> nor is it knowne whether out of ſimplicitie,
or malice,) came down where the Duke, <hi>Don Iuan</hi> and <hi>Lorenzo</hi>
were, ſaying, that Page yonder hath kept up <hi>Cornelia</hi> cloſe, like a
Hawke in a Mew, and could have wiſht that his maſter had not come home ſo
ſoone, that he might have taken his pleaſure of her three or foure dayes
longer. <hi>Lorenzo</hi> overheard this, and askt him what is 
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:58406:52"/>that (my friend) you ſay? where is <hi>Cornelia?</hi>
Above (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Page.) The Duke had no ſooner heard this, but like
lightning he got him up the ſtayres to ſee <hi>Cornelia;</hi> imagining
that ſhe had appeared, and lighted right on the chamber where <hi>Don
Antonio</hi> was, and entring hee ſayd; where art thou <hi>Cornelia?</hi>
where is the life of my life? Here is <hi>Cornelia</hi> anſwered a woman,
that lay wrapt up in a ſheet of the bed with her face covered and
proſecuted her ſpeech, ſaying; This is no ſuch great fault as you would
make it, you need not make ſuch a deale adoe about it, it is no ſuch new or
ſtrange thing for a woman to lye with a Page, that you make ſuch a wonder
of it. <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> who was there preſent, raging with deſpight and
chollor, tooke the ſheet by one of the corners and pull'd it off, and
diſcovered a young woman of no ill aſpect, who out of ſhame clapt her
hands before her face, and made haſte to take her cloaths unto her which
ſerved her inſtead of a pillow, for the bed had none; and by theſe and
other like ſignes they ſaw that ſhee was ſome common hackney which did
ſet out her ſelfe to hyre: The Duke ask't her and willed her that ſhee
ſhould tell him truly whether her name were <hi>Cornelia</hi> or no? She made
him anſwer that it was; and that ſhee had kinsfolke of very good account
and credit in the City, and that none can ſay of themſelves that they will
not drinke of this water.</p>
            <p>The Duke was ſo aſhamed, that hee was almoſt ready to
imagine that the <hi>Spanyards</hi> had put a tricke upon him; But to the end
that hee might not give way to the entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of ſo ill a ſuſpition,
hee turned his backe, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeaking one word <hi>Lorenzo</hi>
following him, they got to their Horſes and went their way, leaving <hi>Don
Iuan</hi> and <hi>Don Antonio</hi> more aſhamed then they; and determined
with themſelues to uſe all puſſible, yea even all impoſſible
dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences in ſeeking out <hi>Cornelia,</hi> and in ſatisfying the Duke of
their truth and good deſires. They put <hi>Santiſtevan</hi> out of their
ſervice for a bold impudent fellow, and turn'd that<pb n="98" facs="tcp:58406:53"/>ſhameleſſe Queane <hi>Cornelia</hi> out of doores; And in that
very inſtant it came into their minde that they had forgotten to tell the
Dake of thoſe jewels, the <hi>Agnus dei,</hi> and the Croſſe of Diamonds
which <hi>Cornelia</hi> had offered them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that by theſe tokens he
might have beene induced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that <hi>Cornelia</hi> had beene in their
power, and that if ſhee were now wanting, they could not doe withall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted forth to tell him this, but they found him not in
<hi>Loren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo's</hi> houſe where they thought hee had beene.</p>
            <p>They met with <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> who told them, that without making
any ſtay at all hee went directly to <hi>Ferrara,</hi> leaving order for the
looking out of his Siſter; They acquainted him with their errand, and with
what they meant to have ſayd to the Duke in their juſt excuſe, but
<hi>Lorenzo</hi> told them that the Duke was very well ſatisfied of their
good procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and that both of them had layd the fault on
<hi>Cornelia's</hi> too much feare, and that God would bee pleaſed that ſhe
ſhould ere long appeare, ſince that they perſwaded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that the
earth had not ſwallowed up the Child, the woman, and her ſelfe.</p>
            <p>With this they did all comfort themſelves; and were not willing
to make inquiry after her by publicke proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but by ſecret
diligences, becauſe her being miſt was knowne by none but her kinſwoman;
and amongſt thoſe who did not know the Dukes intention, his Siſter might
runne the hazzard of her reputation, if they ſhould make a publicke
proclayming of it, and that it would require a great deale of labour and
trouble for to goe ſatisfying every one of thoſe ſuſpitions which a
vehement preſumption ſhould infuſe into them.</p>
            <p>The Duke went forward on his journey, and it ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened by
good fortune, or rather divine Providence had ſo diſpoſed it, that hee
came to that Village of this <hi>Curate,</hi> where were already arrived
<hi>Cornelia,</hi> the Child, the Nurſe, and the Plotter and deviſe of
their going thither; And they had given him account of all the buſineſſe,
and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought<pb n="99" facs="tcp:58406:53"/>his adviſe and coutifell what they were
beſt to doe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Curate</hi> was a great lover of the Duke, to wheſe
houſe fitted and accommodated, like that of a rich and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Clergie man;
the Duke did uſe oftentimes to come from <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and from thence
went a hunting. For hee tooke great pleaſure and delight as well in the
<hi>Curates</hi> cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſitie, as in the wittineſſe and gracefulneſſe
in all whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he either ſayd or did. He was no whit moved or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to ſee the Duke in his houſe, (for as already hath been ſayd) it was not
the firſt time that hee had beene there. But it did grieve and diſcontent
him to ſee him there ſo ſad and melancholy; for hee did preſently
perceive that his minde was troubled and poſſeſſed with ſome
paſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cornelia</hi> had overheard that the Duke of <hi>Ferrara</hi>
was there, and was extreamely troubled thereat, becauſe ſhee did not know
with what intention hee came thither; She wrung her hands, and ranne up and
downe from one place to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, as if ſhe had beene diſtracted and out of
her wits. <hi>Cornelia</hi> would feigne have ſpoken with the
<hi>Carate,</hi> but hee was entertaining the Duke, and had not the leiſure
to talke with her.</p>
            <p>The Duke ſayd unto him, Father, I am come hither I confeſſe
very ſad and heavie, and will not enter to day in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Ferrara,</hi> but be
your gueſt; I pray goe forth, and bid thoſe that came with me, to goe backe
againe to <hi>Ferrara,</hi> onely let <hi>Fabio</hi> ſtay here with me. The
good <hi>Curate</hi> did ſo; and then preſently went to give order for the
entertaining and ſerving of the Duke. And ſo upon this occaſion
<hi>Cornelia</hi> might have the opportunitie to ſpeake with him; who ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him by both the hands, held him faſt, and ſayd unto him. O Father, what is
that the Duke would have? what is it hee comes about? for Gods ſake (ſir)
give him ſome touch, touching my buſines, and ſee if you can ſound
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, and by ſome ſigne or
other, diſcover his intent on. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, ſo carry this
buſineſſe as ſhall ſeeme beſt unto you, and as your great
diſcretion ſhall direct you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:58406:54"/>Whereunto the <hi>Curate</hi> anſwered,
that the Duke was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſad and penſive, but hath not as yet told mee the
cauſe of this his griefe. That which is to bee done, is that you preſently
dreſſe this Child, and make it as neate and fine as poſſibly you can;
adorning him withall your jewells, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe the Duke gave you, and
leave the reſt to mee; <hi>Cornelia</hi> embraced him and kiſſed his
hands, and withdrew her ſelfe to dreſſe and tricke up the Child.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Curate</hi> in the meane while went forth to entertaine
the Duke untill dinner time; and talking and diſcourſing of divers things,
the <hi>Curate</hi> askt the Duke whether hee might be ſo bold, as to learne
from him the cauſe of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy? becauſe a man might plainely
perceive a league of this his ſadneſſe.</p>
            <p>Father (ſayd the Duke) it is a cleere caſe, that the
ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes of the heart will breake out and ſhow themſelves in the
countenance of man or woman; and in our eyes and looks is read the relation of
that which is in our ſoules. And that which grieves mee moſt, is; that I
cannot as yet communicate my ſorrow to any. But truely (my Lord) replied the
<hi>Curate,</hi> if you were but now in caſe, or would bee pleaſed to ſee
things of pleaſure and delight, I could ſhew you one which I keepe to my
ſelfe, which would give you great contentment. Very ſilly and ſimple
(anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Duke) ſhould that man be, who having a remedie offered him
for his maladie would not take it. As you love me (Father) I pray ſhew it me;
this which you now ſpeak of, muſt be ſome of your curioſities, all
which have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to given me ſingular content.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Curate</hi> roſe up from his ſeate, and went where
<hi>Cornelia</hi> was, who had now made an end of dreſſing her ſonne, and
had put on and about him thoſe rich jewells of the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> and
of the <hi>Agnus dei,</hi> with other three moſt precious ſtones, all given
by the Duke to <hi>Cornelia;</hi> and taking the Child in his armes, he went
where the Duke was, deſiring him that he would riſe from his chaire, and
that he would<pb n="101" facs="tcp:58406:54"/>bee pleaſed to take the paines to come to
the window, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the light was there much clearer. Being come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he tooke the Child out of his armes, and put it into thoſe of the Duke; who
when hee had lookt upon it and knew the jewells and ſaw that they were the
ſame which hee had given to <hi>Cornelia;</hi> hee remained aſtoniſhed
and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed: and looking wiſhly on the Child, it ſeemed unto him that hee
ſaw his owne picture, And being full of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, he askt the
<hi>Curate</hi> whoſe Child that was, which in its adorning and dreſſing
ſeemed to bee the Childe of ſome Prince?</p>
            <p>I know not (replyed the <hi>Curate</hi>) onely I know this, that
ſome (I know not how many) moneths ſince, a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Bologna</hi>
brought him hither unto mee, and gave me in charge that I ſhould looke well
unto him, and breed him up; for that he was the ſonne of a valiant and noble
Father, and of a principall and moſt beautifull Mother. There came likewiſe
with this gentleman, a woman for to nurſe the Child; of whom I did demand if
ſhee knew ought concerning the Parents of this Babe? but ſhee told mee
ſhe knew nothing touching that particular. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if the Mother bee ſo
faire as is the Nurſe, ſhee muſt needs be the faireſt woman in all
<hi>Italy.</hi> May we not ſee her ſayd the Duke? yes certainely ſayd the
<hi>Curate.</hi> Come you (ſir) with mee; for if the dreſſing and beauty
of this pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie creature hath thus ſuſpended you, and made you ſtand at
a gaze, as I beleeve and perceive it hath, what will the ſight of its Nurſe
doe? The <hi>Curate</hi> would have taken the Child from the Duke, but hee
would not let him goe till that be had hugg'd him in his boſome, and
beſtowed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kiſſes upon him. The <hi>Curate</hi> in the interim got
him a little before, and calling to <hi>Cornelia,</hi> wiſhed her that ſhee
ſhould come forth without any perturbation at all, for to receive the
Duke.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cornelia</hi> did ſo; and being overtaken with a ſodaine
paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, there are ſo ſuch freſh colours in her face, as did
beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie<pb n="102" facs="tcp:58406:55"/>her beyond meaſure. The Duke was wonderfully
ſtrucken when he ſaw her, and ſhe throwing her ſelfe at his feet would
have kiſſed them. The Duke without ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any one word gave the Child
to the <hi>Curate,</hi> and turning himſelfe from them, he got him with great
haſte out of the houſe; Which <hi>Cornelia</hi> ſeeing, turning her
ſelfe about to the <hi>Curate,</hi> ſayd unto him;</p>
            <p>Aye mee (good ſir) have my lookes ſcared and affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the
Duke that he cannot endure the ſight of mee? Am I growne odious in his eyes?
am I ſo foule that hee doth loath and abhorre mee? Hath he forget thoſe
obligations wherein he ſtands bound unto mee? what would he not vouchſafe
to ſpeake ſo much as one word unto mee? Was his Sonne ſo burthenſome
unto him? was hee ſo weary with holding of him, that he ſo quickly rather
threw, then put him out of his armes? To all which her complaint the
<hi>Curate</hi> replyed not a word, wondring at the ſodaine flight of the
Duke, for it ſeemed unto him to bee rather a flying, then any thing
elſe.</p>
            <p>But all this his haſte was to no other end, ſave to go out to
call <hi>Fabio,</hi> and to ſay unto him; Run <hi>(Fabio)</hi> and make all
the haſte you can to <hi>Bologna,</hi> and bid <hi>Lorenzo Bentivogli,</hi>
and the two <hi>Spaniſh</hi> gentlemen, <hi>Don Iuan de Gamboa,</hi> and
<hi>Don Antonio de Tſanca,</hi> that inſtantly laying all buſineſſes
and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes aſide, they come inſtantly unto mee to this Village. See
<hi>(Fabio)</hi> that you make all poſſible ſpeed, looſe no time, and
by no meanes doe not you come without them, for it importeth mee no leſſe
then my life to ſee them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fabio</hi> was not ſlothfull, but preſently put his Lords
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in execution. Hee being thus diſpatcht and ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, the Duke
preſently returned backe againe where <hi>Cornelia</hi> was; finding her
diſtilling pearled drops of teares. The Duke tooke her into his armes, and
adding teares to teares, a thouſand times hee dranke in the breath of her
mouth, taking great content in each other, though their tongues were bound to
the peace. And ſo in an honeſt<pb n="103" facs="tcp:58406:55"/>and ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>rous ſilence, theſe two happy
lovers and true man and wife did enjoy themſelves. The Childs Nurſe and
<hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bela</hi>) at leaſt as ſhe her ſelfe ſayd) who betweene the
doors of another chamber ſtood obſerving what paſſed betwixt the Duke
and <hi>Cornelia,</hi> were ready for joy to leape out of their skinns, and
were ſo overtaken with this ſo pleaſing a ſight, that they ſeemed
wilde and halfe out of their wits.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Curate</hi> beſtowed a thouſand kiſſes on the
prettie ſweet babe which he had in his armes, and with his right hand which
was diſoccupied and at liberty, he was never ſatisfied with throwing
Benedictions on thoſe two em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced lovers. The <hi>Curates</hi> Mayd who was
not preſent at this great and ſtrange chance, becauſe ſhe was buſie
in dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and providing dinner; when all was ready to be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in,
ſhe came in to call them to ſit downe to their meat which ſtayed on the
table wayting for them. This brake off their ſtrickt embracements, and the
Duke diſincumbred the <hi>Curate</hi> of the Child and tooke him into his
owne armes, and there held him all the while that (that rather well
ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned then ſumptuous) dinner laſted. And being thus ſitting and
eating together, <hi>Cornelia</hi> gave him an account of all that which had
happened till her comming to that houſe, by the adviſe and counſell of
that ſhee ſervant of the two <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> gentlemen, who had
ſerved, protected, and kept her with the honeſteſt and moſt punctuall
<hi>decorum</hi> that could be imagined. The Duke likewiſe recounted unto her
all that which had befallen him till this very inſtant.</p>
            <p>There were preſent waiting on them, the two Nurſes wet, and
dry, who received from the Duke great offers, and large promiſes. In all of
them was renewed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent which they tooke in the happy end of this rare
ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, on lonely ſtayed expecting to make it fuller, and to put it
into the beſt ſtate that poſſibly could be deſired, by the comming of
<hi>Lorenzo,</hi> of <hi>Don Iuan,</hi> and <hi>Don Antonio:</hi> who

who was purpoſely ſent for them, could not informe them of her being found,
becauſe he knew nothing of it.</p>
            <p>The Duke went forth to receive them in a large roome adjoyning
neere unto that where <hi>Cornelia</hi> was; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expreſſions of
any contentment at all: whereupon theſe new come gueſts were very heavie
and ſorrowfull, and looked ſadly one upon another. The Duke cauſed them
to ſit downe, and he himſelfe ſate with them, and directing his ſpeech
to <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> he ſayd unto him;</p>
            <p>You wott well <hi>(Signor Lorenzo Bentivogli)</hi> that I did
never deceive your Siſter, as Heaven, and mine own Conſcience can well
witneſſe for mee; you know likewiſe the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence which I have uſed,
and the deſire which I liave had to finde her out that I might marry her, and
make her my Wife, according unto promiſe. She appeares not, and my word ought
not to be eternall. I am a young man, and not ſo well grounded and

               </gap>. The ſelfe ſame affection
which made me promiſe my ſelfe to be <hi>Cornelias</hi> Husband, did
likewiſe lead me, before I paſt my word unto her, to promiſe marriage to
a Country wench, a husbandmans Daughter of this Village, whom I did think to

<hi>Cornelias</hi> worth; though not to that which my conſcience did dictate

that no man mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with a Wife which doth not appeare; and that it doth not

him, that ſhe may not be found by him whom ſhe abhorreth; I ſay this
<hi>(Signor Lorenzo)</hi> that you may thereby ſee the ſatisfaction, which
I am both willing, and able to give you, that I have not done you any the
leaſt wrong or affront, being that I never had any intention or purpoſe to
do it. And therefore I would have you to give<pb n="105" facs="tcp:58406:56"/>me leave to
comply with my firſt promiſe, and that I may marry this Country Mayd, who
is now here in this houſe.</p>
            <p>Whil'ſt that the Duke was making this ſpeech,
<hi>Lorenzo</hi>'s countenance went, changing it ſelfe into a thouſand
co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, neither could he for his life ſit ſtill after one and the ſame
manner; which were cleare ſignes and manifeſt tokens, that choller went
taking poſſeſſion of all his ſenſes. In the like taking was <hi>Don
luan,</hi> and <hi>Don Antonio,</hi> who did preſently reſolve that the
Duke ſhould not go on with his intention, although it coſt them their
lives.</p>
            <p>The Duke then reading their minde in their faces, ſayd; reſt
you quiet <hi>(Signior Lorenzo)</hi> for before that you ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne mee
any one word in anſwer to mine; I will, that the beauty that you ſhall
ſee in her, whom I am deſirous to make my Wife, may obliege you to give me
leave to do that which I crave of you. For it is ſuch, and ſo beyond all
mortall manner, that it will bee able to plead excuſe for far greater
errours.</p>
            <p>When the Duke was riſen and went his way from them, <hi>Don
Iuan</hi> ſtood up, and reſting both his hands on the armes of the Chayre
where <hi>Don Lorenzo</hi> ſate, hee ſayd unto him in a loud voice; By St.
<hi>Iago</hi> of <hi>Galicia (Signior Lorenzo)</hi> and by the Faith of a
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> which I profeſſe; I vow, that I will as ſoone
ſuffer the Duke to proceed in this his purpoſe, as I intend to turne
<hi>Moore.</hi> As I am a Gentleman, here, even here, and in theſe very hands
of mine, he ſhall either leave his life, or performe his word and promiſe
which hee made to your Siſter the Lady <hi>Cornelia;</hi> or at leaſt to
give them time and reſpite for to ſeeke after her, till ſuch time that
they ſhould certainely know that ſhee were dead; and in the meane while,
not to permit him to Marrie. I am of the ſame opinion anſwered
<hi>Lorenzo;</hi> and of the ſame likewiſe (replied <hi>Don Iuan</hi>) will
my friend and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion <hi>Don Antonio</hi> bee.</p>
            <p>While they were thus debating this buſineſſe, from out a
Roome juſt before them, came <hi>Cornelia</hi> in the middle, 
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:58406:57"/>betwixt the <hi>Curate,</hi> and the Duke, who led her by
the hand. After whom followed <hi>Sulpicia, Cornelias</hi> Gentlewoman, (the
Duke having ſent for her to <hi>Ferrara</hi>) and the two Nurſes to the
Child, and the Woman belonging to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Gentlemen.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Lorenzo</hi> ſaw his Siſter, and had taken a full
view of her, and knew that it was ſhee (for at firſt, the
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilitie, to his ſeeming of ſuch a ſucceſſe, did not
ſuffer him to enter truely into the reckoning of it,) ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling out of
haſte, hee went to throw himſelfe at the Dukes feete; hee tooke him up, and
placed him in his Siſters armes, who embraced him with all poſſible
demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of joy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Iuan,</hi> and <hi>Don Antonio,</hi> told the Duke that
hee had put upon them the moſt diſcreet, and moſt ſavourie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit in
the World.</p>
            <p>The Duke tooke the Childe which <hi>Sulpicia</hi> brought in her
armes, and giving it to <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> ſayd; Heere Brother, take your
Nephew, and my Sonne, and ſee now, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no you will give mee leave to
marry with this Country Laſſe, who is the firſt that ever I plighted my
faith unto, that I would marry her.</p>
            <p>It were an endleſſe peece of worke, to recount that which
<hi>Lorenzo</hi> replyed; that which <hi>Don Iuan</hi> asked him; that which
<hi>Don Antonio</hi> thought, the rejoycing of the <hi>Curate,</hi> the joy of
<hi>Sulpicia,</hi> the content of the adviſers, the admiration of
<hi>Fabio,</hi> the <hi>Inbile</hi> of the Nurſe; and in a word, the generall
contentment of all.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Curate</hi> forthwith married them, <hi>Don Iuan de
Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boa</hi> being the Father that gave her. And amongſt them all it was
concluded and agreed upon, that thoſe Nuptialls ſhould bee ſecret, and
concealed; till they ſhould ſee how it fared with the Dutcheſſe his
Mother, who was almoſt ſpent, by reaſon of her long ſickeneſſe: and
that in the meane while, <hi>Cornelia</hi> ſhould return with her brother to
<hi>Bologna.</hi> All this was done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:58406:57"/>The Dutcheſſe ſhortly after dyed, and
<hi>Cornelia</hi> entred into <hi>Ferrara,</hi> cheering the World with her
fayre preſence: Mourning weeds, were turned into gay and rich cloathes, The
Nurſes were liberally rewarded. <hi>Sulpicia</hi> was married to <hi>Fabio,
Don Antonio,</hi> and <hi>Don Iuan</hi> were wonderfull well contented, that it
was there good fortune, that they had beene ſome way ſeruiceable to the
Duke; who offered them two of his neare kinſwomen to bee their Wives, with
exceeding rich Dowries. But they told him, that the Gentlemen of
<hi>Biſcay,</hi> for the moſt part did marry in their owne Countrey: and
that not out of any ſcorne, (for that was not poſſible) but for to comply
with that commendable cuſtome, and the will of their Parents, who had already
provided Wives for them; they did not, nor could accept of this his moſt
noble offer.</p>
            <p>The Duke admitted of their excuſe, and by honeſt and
honourable meanes, and ſeeking after lawfull occaſions, hee ſent them
many Preſents to <hi>Bologna,</hi> and ſome ſo rich, and that in ſo
good a ſeaſon and conjuncture; that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they might not admit of them,
leaſt it might ſeeme that they received pay for their ſervice, yet the
time wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they came, did facilitate their kinde acceptance of them.
Eſpecially thoſe which hee ſent them at their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for <hi>Spame:</hi>
and thoſe which hee gave them when they went to <hi>Ferrara</hi> to take
their leave of him, where they found <hi>Cornelia</hi> accompanied with other
Ladies, amongſt whom, her tranſcendent beauty, and incomparable ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
made her ſhine with as much ſuperiority, as a Starre of a greater magnitude
exceeds in ſplendour the leſſer Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manaries of its owne Spheare. The Duke
being (according to all the grounds of reaſon and love) more enamoured of her
then ever.</p>
            <p>The Dutcheſſe gave her Croſſe of Diamonds to <hi>Don
Iuan,</hi> and her <hi>Agnus dei,</hi> to <hi>Don Antonio;</hi> who when they
ſaw that all their mannerly refuſalls would not ſerve their turn, they
with an unwilling willingneſſe received them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:58406:58"/>They came to <hi>Spaine,</hi> into their owne
Countrey, where they were married to rich, principall, and beautifull yong
Women, continuing ſtill their correſpondencie with the Duke, and the
Dutcheſſe; and with <hi>Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior Lorenzo Bentivogli,</hi> to the great good
liking on either part.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>H the lamentable Ruines of unhappie <hi>Nicoſia!</hi> The
bloud of thy valiant and unfortunate defenders being yet ſcarce drie. If (as
thou art ſenſleſſe thereof) thou hadſt any feeling at all in this
deſolate and woefull eſtate wherein now wee are, we might joyntly bewaile
our misfortunes and that wretched eſtate and condition wherein wee are; And
happily having a companion in them, it would help to eaſe mee in ſome
ſort of my torment, and make that burthen of my griefe the lighter; which I
finde ſo heavie (I had almoſt ſayd inſupportable) for mee to beare. Yet
there is ſome hope left unto thee, that theſe thy ſtrong Towers
diſmantled and layd levell with the ground; thou mayſt one day ſee them,
(though not in ſo juſt a defence, as that wherein they were overthrowne)
raiſed to their, former height and ſtrength.</p>
            <p>But I, (of all unfortunate, the moſt unfortunate man,) what good
can I hope for in that miſerable ſtraight wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in<pb n="110" facs="tcp:58406:59"/>I
finde my ſelfe? yea, though I ſhould returne to the ſame eſtate and
condition wherein I was, before I fell into this; ſuch is my misfortune, that
when I was free and at liberty, I knew not what happineſſe was; and now in
my thraldome and captivitie, I neither have it, nor hope it.</p>
            <p>Theſe words did a Chriſtian Captive utter, looking with a
ſad and heavie countenance from the riſing of a hill on the ruined Walls of
the late loſt <hi>Nicoſia.</hi> And thus did he talke with them, and
compared his miſeries with theirs, as if they had beene able to underſtand
him. (The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and proper condition of afflicted perſons, who being
violently carried away with their owne feigned fancies, and imaginary
conceptions; doe, and ſay things beyond all reaſon, and without any good
diſcourſe, and adviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)</p>
            <p>Now whil'ſt hee was thus diſcourſing with himſelfe from
out a <hi>Pavilion,</hi> or one of thoſe Tents pitched there in the field,
not farre from him iſſued out a <hi>Turke,</hi> a handſome young man, of
a good preſence, an ingenious aſpect, and accompanied with ſpirit and
mettall anſwerable to his lookes; who drawing neere unto the
<hi>Chriſtian,</hi> without much ceremonie, yet in a fayre and civill way,
ſayd unto him; Sir, I durſt lay a wager with you, that thoſe your
penſive thoughts which I read in your face have brought you hither. You read
aright, anſwered <hi>Ricardo,</hi> (for this was the Captives name) they have
brought mee hither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: But what doth it avayle mee? ſince in no place
whether ſo ever I go, I am ſo farre from procuring a peace; that I cannot
obtaine a truce, or any the leaſt ceſſation of them. Nay rather theſe
Ruines which from hence diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover themſelves unto mee, have rather
increaſed my ſorrowes. Thoſe of <hi>Nicoſia</hi> you meane? replied the
<hi>Turke;</hi> What other ſhould I meane (anſwered <hi>Ricardo</hi>)
ſince there are no other which here offer themſelves to my view. You have
great cauſe (quoth the <hi>Turke</hi>) to weepe, if you<pb n="111" facs="tcp:58406:59"/>entertaine your thoughts with theſe and the like
contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations.</p>
            <p>For they, who but ſome two yeares ſince had ſeene this
famous and rich Iſland of <hi>Cyprus</hi> in its proſperitie, and peaceable
eſtate; the Inhabitants thereof enjoying all that humane happines and
felicitie, which the Heavens could grant unto men, or themſelves deſire,
and now to ſee them baniſhed out of it, or made miſerable ſlaves in it;
Who can bee ſo hard hearted, as to forbeare from bewai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling its calamity and
misfortune.</p>
            <p>But let us leave talking of theſe things ſince they are
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medileſſe, and let us come to your owne boſome ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, for I
deſire to ſee if they bee ſuch, as you voyce them to bee. And therefore,
I earneſtly entreate and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, and conjure thee, by that which thou
oweſt to thoſe good offices I have done thee; the good will I beare thee,
the love I have ſhowne thee, and by that which ought to obliege thee
thereunto; in that wee are both of one and the ſame Country, and bred up in
our Child-hood together; that thou wilt deale freely with me, and lay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
unto me what is the cauſe which makes thee ſo excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſad and
melancholy? For how be it, Captivity alone of it ſelfe bee ſufficient to
grieve the ſtouteſt heart in the World, and to checke its mirth; though
otherwiſe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally inclined thereunto, yet notwithſtanding imagine, that
the current of your diſaſters hath a farther reach and deeper bottome.</p>
            <p>For generous minds (ſuch as thine is) do not uſe to yeeld and
render up themſelves to common &amp; ordinary misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, in ſuch a
meaſure, as to make ſhew of extraordinary ſorrowes. And I am the rather
induced to beleeve what I conceive, becauſe I know that you are not ſo
poore, but that you are well enough able to pay any reaſonable Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
they ſhall require of you. Nor are you clapt up in the Towers of the blacke
Sea, as a priſoner of note, or Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of conſideration, who late, or
never obtaines his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired<pb n="112" facs="tcp:58406:60"/>liberty. And therfore you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ill fortune not having taken from you
the hope of ſeeing your ſelfe a free man; and yet notwithſtanding all
this, when I ſee thee ſo much over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with ſorrowes, and making
ſuch miſerable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations of thy misfortunes; It is not much that I
i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine that the paine proceeds from ſome other cauſe then thy loſt
liberty, which I entreat thee to acquaint mee withall; offering thee all the
aſſiſtance I am able to give thee Perhaps, to the end that I may be
ſerviceable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, Fortune in her wheeling hath brought this about, that
I ſhould bee clad in this habite which I ſo much hate and abhorre.</p>
            <p>Thou knoweſt already <hi>(Ricardo)</hi> that my Maſter is
<hi>Cadi</hi> of this Citie (which is the ſame, as to be it's
<hi>Biſhop;</hi>) Thou likewiſe knoweſt the great ſway which he beareth
here, and how much I am able to do with him. Together with this, thou art not
ignorant of the fervent deſire and infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med zeale which I have, not to dye
in this eſtate which I thus ſeeme to profeſſe; but God knowes my heart,
and if ever I ſhould come to be put to my tryall, I am reſolved o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly to
confeſſe, and in a loud voice to publiſh to the whole world, the Faith of
<hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> from which my few yeares, and leſſe
underſtanding ſeparated mee; though that I were ſure that ſuch a
confeſſion ſhould coſt mee my life; for that I may free my ſelfe from
loſing that of my ſoule, I ſhould thinke the loſing of that of my body
very well employed.</p>
            <p>Out of all this which hath beene ſayd unto thee, I leave it to
thy ſelfe to inferre the concluſion, and that thou wilt take it into thy
deeper and better conſideration; whether my proffered friendſhip may be
proffitable and uſefull un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee.</p>
            <p>Now that I may know what remedies thy misfortune requires, and
what medicines I may apply both for the eaſing and curing of it; it is
requeſite, that thou recount it unto mee; the relation thereof being as
neceſſary for me,<pb n="113" facs="tcp:58406:60"/>as that of the rich Patient to his
Phiſitian; aſſuring thee in the faith of a friend, that thou ſhalt
depoſite it in the dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt and darkeſt den of ſilence, never to come
to light.</p>
            <p>To all theſe words of his, <hi>Ricardo</hi> gave an attentive
eare, though his tongue were ſilent; but ſeeing himſelfe oblieged by them
and his owne neceſſity, returned him thereunto this anſwer.</p>
            <p>If as thou haſt hit the right veine Oh my dear friend
<hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamut</hi> (for ſo was this <hi>Turke</hi> called) touching that which
thou imagineſt of my misfortune, thou couldſt hit as right upon its remedy;
I ſhould hold my ſelfe happy in my loſt liberty, and would not change my
unhappines, for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt happines that may be imagined But I wott well,
that it is ſuch, that all the World may take notice of the cauſe whence it
proceedeth; but that man ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not therin be found, which dare undertake not onely
the finding out of any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for it, but of giving it any the leaſt eaſe.
And to the end that thou mayſt reſt thy ſelfe throughly ſatisfied of
the truth therof, I will relate the ſame unto thee, as briefly and
compendiouſly as I can, ſhutting up much in a few words. But before I enter
into this confuſed laborinth of my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries; I would firſt have thee to
recount unto mee, what is the cauſe why <hi>Azam Baſhawe</hi> my maſter
hath pitched here in this field theſe <hi>Tents</hi> and <hi>Pavilions,</hi>
before hee maketh his entry into <hi>Nicoſia,</hi> being deputed (and to that
purpoſe bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his proviſion with him) to bee <hi>Viceroy</hi> there, or
<hi>Baſhawe,</hi> the uſeuall ſtile or title which the <hi>Turks</hi>
give their <hi>Viceroy's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will (anſwered <hi>Mahamut</hi>) anſwer your demand in a few
words; and therefore would have you to know, that it is a cuſtome amongſt
the <hi>Turks,</hi> that they who come to be <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>royes</hi> of ſome
<hi>Province,</hi> do not inſtantly enter into the Citie where their
Predeceſſor reſideth, till he iſſueth out of it, and leave the
reſidence freely to his Succeſſors. Now when the new <hi>Baſhawe</hi>
hath made his entrance, the old one ſtayes without in the field, expecting
what accuſations ſhal come againſt him, and what miſdemeanours (during
his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)<pb n="114" facs="tcp:58406:61"/>they ſhall lay to his charge; which
being alleadged and proved, are recorded, and a note taken of them, all
poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility being taken away from him of enterviewing, either to help
himſelf by ſuborning of witneſſes, or by his friends, unles he have
made his way before hand, for the clearing of himſelfe. Now the other being
ſetled in his <hi>Reſidence,</hi> there is given by him to him that leaves
his <hi>Charge,</hi> a ſcroll of Parchment ſealed up very cloſe, and
therewith he preſents himſelfe at the gate of the <hi>Grand-Signior;</hi>
that is to ſay, in the Court before the <hi>Grand-Councell</hi> of the great
<hi>Turke;</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeene and peruſed by the
<hi>Viſir-Baſhaw,</hi> and by thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther foure inferiour
<hi>Baſhawes;</hi> they either reward, or puniſh him, according to the
relation that is made of his <hi>Reſidencie:</hi> In caſe that he come home
faulty, with money he redeems and excuſeth his puniſhment: but if
faultleſſe, and they do not reward him (as commonly it falleth out) with
gifts and preſents, he procureth that <hi>Charge</hi> which himſelfe moſt
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth. For places of command and offices are not given for merit, but for
money, all is ſold, and all bought. They who have the Proviſion, (or as we
ſtile it, commiſſion and authoritie for the conferring of charges and
offices,) robbe thoſe which are to have theſe offices and charges, and
fleece them as neare as the ſheeres can goe. And they again out of this their
bought office, gather wealth and ſubſtance for to buy another, which
promiſeth much more gaine. All goes as I tell you, all this Empire is
violent, a ſigne that it will not laſt long. For that reaſon then that I
have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thee, thy maſter <hi>Azam Baſhawe</hi> hath remained in this
field foure dayes; and he of <hi>Nicoſia,</hi> that he hath not as yet come
forth as he ought to have done; the cauſe is, that he hath been very ſicke,
but is now upon the mending hand; and will without faile come forth either to
day or to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row at the fartheſt; and is to lodge in certain Tents which are
pitcht behind this riſing hill, which as yet thou haſt not ſeene; and thy
maſter is forth with to enter into the Citie. And having made this already
delivered, known unto thee,<pb n="115" facs="tcp:58406:61"/>is all the ſatisfaction that
I can give to your propounded demaund.</p>
            <p>Liſten then unto mee, replied <hi>Ricardo;</hi> but I know not,
whether I ſhall be as good as my word, in cumplying with that which I
formerly promiſed; that I would in a few words recounnt unto you my
misfortunes, they being ſo large, that to make up the full meaſure of them,
I want words enough to do it; yet notwithſtanding, I wil do here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in what may
be, and as time and your patience will permit.</p>
            <p>But let me firſt of all aske you, if you know in our town of
<hi>Trapana,</hi> a <hi>Damoſell</hi> to whom <hi>Fame</hi> hath given the
name of the faireſt woman in all <hi>Slcily;</hi> in whoſe praiſe all
curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous tongues have ſpent themſelves, and of whom the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
judgements have ratified, that ſhe was the perfecteſt peece of beauty that
the paſt age had, the preſent hath, and that which is to come can hope to
have; one of whom the Poets ſang, that her haires were golden wyars, her
eyes, two reſplendent Suns; and her cheeks, pure damask-roſes; her teeth,
Pearles; her lips, Rubies; her necke, Alablaſter; and that her parts with the
whole frame, and the whole with her parts, made up a moſt pleaſing harmony,
and moſt harmonious concord. Nature ſpreading over the whole compoſure
ſuch a ſweet delightfulneſſe of colours, ſo naturall, and ſo
perfect, that envie it ſelfe cannot taxe her in any one particular.</p>
            <p>And is it poſſible <hi>(Mahamut)</hi> that all this while thou
haſt not told me yet who ſhee is, and by what name ſhe is called? I
undoubtedly beleeve, that either thou doſt not heare mee, or that when thou
waſt in <hi>Trapana,</hi> thou didſt want thy ſences. <hi>Mahamut</hi>
hereunto anſwered; that if ſhee whom thou haſt ſet forth with ſuch
extreames of beauty bee not <hi>Leoniſa,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Rodolphus
Florencius,</hi> I know not who ſhee is; for ſhee alone had that fame which
you ſpeake of.</p>
            <p>This is ſhe, oh <hi>Mahamut</hi> (replied <hi>Ricardo</hi>) this
is ſhe (oh my dear friend) who is the principall cauſe of all my felicity, 
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:58406:62"/>and of all my misfortune. This is ſhee, and not my
loſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, for whom mine eyes have, do, and ſhall-ſhed teares not to
bee numbered; This is ſhee, for whom my heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burning ſighes inflame the
ayre farre and neere: And this is ſhee, for whom my words weary heaven, which
heares them, and the eares of thoſe which hearken unto them. This is ſhee,
for whom thou tookeſt mee to be mad, or at leaſt, for a man of ſmall
worth, and leſſe courage. This <hi>Leoniſa,</hi> to me a Lyoneſſe,
and to another a meeke and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Lambe; is ſhee which holds mee in this
wretched and miſerable eſtate.</p>
            <p>For I muſt give thee to underſtand, that from my ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
yeares, or at leaſt, ever ſince I had the uſe of reaſon, I did not
onely love, but adore her; and did ſerve her with ſuch ſolicitude and
devotion, as if neither on earth, nor in Heaven there were any other Deitie for
mee to ſerve and adore, ſave her ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Her kinsfolke and Parents knew my deſires, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
withall, that they were directed to an honeſt and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous end. And that
therefore, many a time and oft (which eſcaped not my knowledg) they
acquainted <hi>Leoniſa</hi> with the fervent love and affection I bare unto
her, for the better diſpoſing of her will to accept mee for her
Husband.</p>
            <p>But ſhee, who had placed her eyes on <hi>Cornelio,</hi> the
Sonne of <hi>Aſcanio Rotulo,</hi> (whom you know very well) a young Gallant,
neate and ſpruce, with white hands, and curled haires, having a melifluous
voice, and amorous words at will; and in a word, being all made of <hi>Amber,
Muske,</hi> and <hi>Civet,</hi> clad in <hi>Tiſſue,</hi> adorned with rich
embroyderies,) would not vouchſafe to caſt ſo much as one glaunce of her
eye on my countenance, which was not ſo delicate as that of
<hi>Cornelio,</hi> neither would entertaine (notwithſtanding my beſt
endeavours to pleaſe her) with thankefulneſſe, my many and continuall
ſervices, requiting my good will with diſdaine and hatred: And to ſuch
extreames did the exceſſe of my love bring mee, that I ſhould have held
my<pb n="117" facs="tcp:58406:62"/>ſelfe happie, had her diſdaines and unkindneſſes
kil'd me outright, that I might not have liv'd to have ſeene her conferre
ſuch open, though honeſt favours on <hi>Cornelio.</hi> Conſider now,
being anguiſhed with diſdaine and hatred, and almoſt mad with the cruell
rage of jealouſie, in what miſerable caſe (you may imagine) my ſoule
was, two ſuch mortall plagues reigning therein. <hi>Leoniſa's</hi> Parents
diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled thoſe favours which ſhe did to <hi>Cornelio;</hi> beleeving
(as they had good reaſon to beleeve it,) that the young man attracted by her
moſt exqueſite and incomparable beautie (which none could match, but her
owne) would make choice of her for his Spouſe, and ſo in him gaine a richer
ſonne in Law, then in me: and well (if he were ſo) might he be ſo. But I
dare be bold to ſay, (without arrogacie be it ſpoken) that as good bloud
runs in my veines, as his; my quality and condition nothing inferiour to his;
and for his minde, it cannot bee more noble then mine, nor his valour goe
beyond mine: But that indeed which did o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ballance mee, was
<hi>Leoniſia's</hi> favour, and her Parents furthering the buſineſſe;
and this onely made the ſcales uneven, by their enclining to
<hi>Cornelio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now it ſo fell out, that perſiſting in the purſuite of my
pretenſions, it came to my knowledge, that one day in the moneth of
<hi>May</hi> laſt paſt; which this very day makes up a yeare, three dayes,
and five houres; <hi>Leoniſia,</hi> her Parents, and <hi>Cornelio,</hi> and
ſome friends of his, went to ſolace them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, accompanied with their
kindred, and ſervants to <hi>Aſcanio</hi> his Garden, neare adjoyning to
the Sea-ſide, in the way that leads to the Salt-pits.</p>
            <p>I know that place paſſing well (ſayd <hi>Mahamut,</hi>) goe

wiſht I had beene there but foure minutes.</p>
            <p>I knew that (replied <hi>Ricardo</hi>) and in that very inſtant
that I knew it, my ſoule was poſſeſſed with ſuch a fury, ſuch a
rage, and ſuch a hell of jealouſies, and with that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemencie and rigour,
that it bereaved mee of my ſenſes,<pb n="118" facs="tcp:58406:63"/>as thou ſhalt
plainely, by that which I preſently ſee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> did, which was this.</p>
            <p>I hyed mee to the Garden where I was told they were, where I found
moſt of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany ſolaſing themſelves, and <hi>Cornelio</hi> &amp;
<hi>Leoniſa</hi> ſitting under a Walnut-tree ſomewhat out of the way from
the reſt. How my ſight pleaſed them I doe not know, but know, to ſay
ſo much of my ſelfe, that her ſight wrought ſo upon mee, that I loſt
the ſight of mine owne eyes; and ſtood ſtocke ſtill like a
<hi>Statuaa,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either voice, or motion. But I continued not long
ſo, before that my anger awakened my choler, choler, heated my bloud; my
bloud, inflamed rage; and rage gave mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to my hands, and tongue. Howbeit my
hands were bound by the reſpect which (me'thought) was due to that fayre face
which I had before mee; But my tongue breaking ſilence, vented forth theſe
words;</p>
            <p>How canſt thou finde in thy heart, how give thy ſelfe content
(Oh thou mortall enemie of my reſt) in having, (and therin taking ſo much
pleaſure) before thine eyes, the cauſe which muſt make mine to overflow
with rivers of teares; and by my continuall weeping, become another Deluge?
Come, come, (cruell as thou art) a little nearer, and wreathe thy twining Ivie,
about this unprofitable truncke, which wooes thy embracings. Let him lay his
head in thy lap, and let thy fingers learne to play with thoſe breaded lockes
of this thy new <hi>Ganimede;</hi> what thou wilt doe, doe quickly; Make an end
at once of delivering up the poſſeſſion of thy ſelfe, to the greene
and ungoverned yeares of this your <hi>Minion;</hi> to the end, that I loſing
all hope of obtaining thee; may together with that end, this my life, ſo much
by mee a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>orred.</p>
            <p>Thinkſt thou peradventure (thou proud and ill adviſed
Damoſell) that this young <hi>Princoxe,</hi> preſumptuous by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of
his riches; arrogant, by your gracing of him, unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, in that hee is
too young; and inſolent by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying on his Linage, will love as he ought,
and you deſerve?<pb n="119" facs="tcp:58406:63"/>No, hee cannot, no, hee knowes not how
to love con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly; nor to eſteeme that which is in eſtimable, nor come
to have that underſtanding and knowledge, which accompanies ripe and
experimented yeares. If you thinke ſo, doe not thinke it; for the World hath
no other good thing, ſave the doing of its actions alwaies after one and the
ſame manner. For none are deceived, but by their owne ignorance: In yong men
there is much inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; in rich, pride; vanitie in the arrogant; in the
beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, diſdaine; and in thoſe that have all theſe,
fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which is the mother of all ill ſucceſſe</p>
            <p>And thou (oh young Gallant) art ſuch a one, who thinkſt to
carry all before thee, and to goe cleare away with that reward, which is more
due to my good deſires, then thy idle proteſtations; Why doſt thou not
ariſe from that Carpet of flowers whereon thou lyeſt, and come to take this
my ſoule from me, which ſo deadly hateth thine? Not becauſe thou
offendeſt me in that which thou doeſt, but becauſe thou knoweſt not how
to eſteeme that good which fortune gives thee: and it is cleare and evident,
that thou makſt little reckoning of it, ſince thou wilt not riſe up to
defend it, that thou mayſt not put thy ſelfe to the hazzard of
diſcompoſing that painted compoſure of thy gay cloathes. If
<hi>Achilles</hi> had had thy repoſed condition, or beene of thy cold temper;
<hi>Vlyſſes</hi> might very well have beene aſſured, that he would not
have gone through with that which hee undertooke. Go, get thee gone and ſport
thy ſelfe amongſt thy Mothers mayds, and there have a care of kembing and
curling thy lockes, and keeping thy hands cleane and white; thou art fitter to
handle ſoft ſilks, then a hard hilted ſword.</p>
            <p>All theſe words could not move <hi>Cornelio</hi> to riſe from
the place where I found him, but ſate him ſtill looking u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon mee as one
agaſt, not once offering to ſtirre. But the voice wherewith I uttered
theſe words which you have heard, occaſioned the people which were walking
in the<pb n="120" facs="tcp:58406:64"/>garden to draw nearer, ſtood a little while
liſtening, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring many other diſgracefull ſpeeches which I gave him,
and thereupon made in; who taking courage by their comming (for all or moſt
of them were his kinsfolke, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, or friends) hee made ſhow of
riſing; but before he was fully upon his feete, I layd hand on my ſword,
drew it, and did ſet not onely upon him, but on as many as were there.
<hi>Leoniſa</hi> no ſooner ſaw my glittering ſword, but ſhee fell
into a deadly ſwound, which did put greater courage into mee, and ſtirre up
greater deſpighte: and I cannot ſay, whether thoſe ſo many which did
ſet upon mee, ſought onely to defend themſelves, as we ſee men
uſually doe againſt a furious mad man; or whether it were my good fortune
and diligence, or Heavens diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, to expoſe me to greater evills, and
to reſerve mee to farther miſeries. In concluſion, I wounded ſeven or
eight of them which came next to my hand; <hi>Cornelio</hi> betooke himſelfe
to his heeles, and by his ſwift flight eſcaped my hands.</p>
            <p>Being in this ſo manifeſt a danger hemmed in by my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
who now (ſeeing their bloud runne from them, and inrage<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> with the wrong which they had received) ſought to
revenge themſelves upon mee: Loe <hi>Fortune</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided aremedie for this
miſchiefe, but ſuch a one as was worſe than the diſeaſe, for better
had it beene for mee there to have left my life, then in reſtoring it mee by
ſo ſtrange and unexpected a meanes, to come to loſe it every houre a
thouſand and a thouſand times over and over. And this it was; That on the
ſodaine there ruſhed into the garden a great number of <hi>Turkes,</hi>
Pirates of <hi>Viſerta,</hi> who with two Gallies had put into a little
Creeke of the Sea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene two rockes hard by the ſhoare, where they
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imbarked themſelves without being heard or ſeene by the
<hi>Centinells</hi> of the Watch-Towers, nor diſcovered by thoſe ſcouts,
whoſe dayly office it was to ſcoure the Coaſts, and ſee that all was
cleare. When my adverſaries had eſpied <pb n="121" facs="tcp:58406:64"/>them, leaving
me alone; they, with the reſt in the garden, ranne their way as faſt as
their legs would carry them, and ſhifted ſo well for themſelves, that
they had got them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of their danger, and put themſelves in
ſafetie. So that of all the whole companies, the <hi>Turkes</hi> tooke no
more Captives, but three perſons beſides <hi>Leoniſa,</hi> who lay there
ſtill in a ſwound. They tooke me after they had ſhrewdly wounded me in
foure ſeverall places, revenged before by me on foure <hi>Turkes</hi> whom I
left dead in the place.</p>
            <p>This aſſault ended, the <hi>Turks</hi> with their accuſtomed
dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and not being very well pleaſed with the ſucceſſe; made
haſte to embarke themſelves, and preſently put far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſea, ſo
that what with their ſailes, and help of their Oares, in a ſhort ſpace
they recovered <hi>Fabiana;</hi> where they muſtered their men, and finding
that the ſlaine were foure ſouldiers, <hi>Levant-men</hi> (as they call
them,) being of the beſt and choiſeſt, and of moſt eſteem amongſt
them, they were the more willing and deſirous to take their revenge of me.
And therefore the <hi>Admirall</hi> of the Captaine-galley commanded them to
hang me up on the mayn yard. All this while <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſa</hi> ſtood looking
on this ſpeedy preparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for my death, (who was now come again to her
ſelfe) and ſeeing me in the power of theſe <hi>Pirats,</hi> the teares
trickled down in great abundance from her beauteous eyes, and wringing her
ſoft and delicate hands, not ſpeaking ſo much as one word; gave diligent
eare and was very attentive to hear if ſhe could un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what the
<hi>Turkes</hi> ſaid. But one of the <hi>Chriſtian-ſlaves</hi> that was
chained to the Oare, ſpake to her in <hi>Italian,</hi> giving her to
underſtand how that the Captaine had given order to have that
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> hanged up (pointing unto me) becauſe I had ſlaine in
her defence, foure of the beſt ſouldiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to his Galleys. Which
being heard and underſtood by <hi>Leoniſa;</hi> (being the firſt time
that ever ſhee ſhew'd her ſelfe pittifull towards me) ſhe will'd the
ſayd ſlave that he ſhould ſpeake unto the <hi>Turkes</hi> to ſpare
his life, and not to hang him; for in ſo doing they would loſe a great
ranſome,<pb n="122" facs="tcp:58406:65"/>and that he ſhould adviſe them to tack
about, and make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine for <hi>Trapana,</hi> where his ranſome would
preſently be brought aboord unto them. This I ſay was the firſt, and the
laſt kindneſſe which <hi>Leoniſa</hi> uſed towards mee, and all this
for my greater ill. The <hi>Turks</hi> hearing what their Captive told them,
did eaſily beleeve him; and this their hope of profit, turned the courſe of
their choller. The very next morning hanging out a flag of peace, they anchored
before <hi>Trapana.</hi> That night thou maiſt better conceive then I utter,
with what a deale of griefe I paſt it over; not ſo much for my wounds
ſake, though they were very ſore and painfull, as to thinke on the perill
wherein my cruell enemie was amongſt theſe <hi>Barbarous</hi> people. Being
come now as I told thee to the Citie, one of the Galleys entred the Haven, the
other ſtood off. All the Citizens flocked to the ſea-ſide, the
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſtanding as thicke one by another, as the ſhoare
would give them leave. And that Carpet-knight <hi>Cornelio</hi> ſtood afar
off obſerving what paſſed in the Galley, whil'ſt my Steward was
treating of my ranſome; to whom I had given order that he ſhould in no
wiſe treate of my liberty, but of that of <hi>Leoniſa:</hi> and that he
ſhould give for the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her, all whatſoever I was worth, either in
lands, or goods. And I willed him moreover, that hee ſhould goe a ſhoare
and tell <hi>Leoniſa's</hi> Parents, that they ſhould leave it to him to
treate of their Daughters liberty.</p>
            <p>This being done, the chiefe Captain who was a <hi>Grecian,</hi>
but a <hi>Renegado,</hi> his name <hi>Yſuph,</hi> demanded for
<hi>Leoniſa,</hi> 6000 Crownes, and for my ſelfe foure, thouſand, and
that hee would not ſell the one without the other; ſetting this ſo great
a priſe (as I was given afterwards to underſtand) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was
enamoured of <hi>Leoniſa,</hi> and was therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing ſhe ſhould be
redeemed; purpoſing to give to the Captaine of the other Galley (with whom he
was to ſhare the one halfe of the prize) my ſelfe at the rate of 4000
Crownes in ready money, and 1000 more in other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, which made up
5000, prizing <hi>Leoniſa</hi> at other 5000.<pb n="123" facs="tcp:58406:65"/>And this
was the reaſon why he rated us two in ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crownes.
<hi>Leoniſa's</hi> Parents offered him nothing on their part, relying on the
promiſe which on my part my Steward had made them; neither did
<hi>Cornelio</hi> ſo much as once open his lips to offer any thing towards
her ranſome. And ſo after many demaunds and anſwers, my Steward concluded
the buſineſſe, with giving for <hi>Leoniſa</hi> 5000, and for mee 3000
Crownes. <hi>Yſuph</hi> accepted this offer, forced thereunto by the
perſwaſions of his companion, and all the reſt of their Souldiers. But
becauſe my Steward had not ſo much money in caſh, hee entreated onely
three daies time to make up the full ſumme, with intention to ſell my goods
under hand, and at a cheape rate, till he had got ſo much together as would
pay the ranſome. <hi>Yſuph</hi> was glad of this, thinking with himſelfe
in the mean while to finde ſome occaſion that the bargaine might not goe
forward; and ſo returning backe againe to the Iſland of <hi>Fabiana,</hi>
he ſayd, that by that time the three dayes were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, he would not faile
to be there with them, to receive the money according to the agreement.</p>
            <p>But ſpitefull and ungratefull <hi>Fortime,</hi> not yet wearied
out with ill entreating mee; had ſo ordained it, that a Gallies boy who
ſate on the top of the maſt, as the <hi>Turkes Centinell</hi> diſcovered
afarre off at Sea, ſixe <hi>Italian</hi> Gallies, and did gueſſe (which
was true) that they were either of <hi>Malta,</hi> or <hi>Sicily.</hi> Hee came
running downe with all the haſte hee could to give them newes thereof; and in
a trice the <hi>Turkes</hi> embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked themſelves, who were a ſhoare, ſome
dreſſing their dinner, ſome waſhing their linnen; and weighing anchor
in an inſtant, hoyſing ſaile, and working hard with their Oares, turning
their Prows towards <hi>Barbary;</hi> in leſſe then two houres, they loſt
the ſight of thoſe Gallies, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhadowed with the Iſland,
and covered from kenne by the approaching night, they were ſecured from that
feare which afrighted them.</p>
            <p>Now I leave it to thy good conſideration (my friend 
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:58406:66"/>
               <hi>Mahamut</hi>) how much my minde was troubled in this
voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, finding it to fall out ſo croſſe and contrary to that which I
expected: and much more, when the next day the two Gallies reaching the
Iſland of <hi>Pantanalea</hi> on the South part, the <hi>Turks</hi> went a
ſhoare to get them wood, and freſh victuals; but moſt of all, when I
ſaw both the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines land, and fell to ſharing between them in equall
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion all thoſe prizes they had taken, each action of theſe, was to
mee a delayed death. Comming then at laſt to the dividing of my ſelfe, and
<hi>Leoniſa; Yſupb</hi> gave to <hi>Fetala,</hi> (for ſo was that
Captaine of the other Galley called) ſixe <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> foure for
the Oare, and two very beautifull boyes, both naturalls of <hi>Corſo,</hi>
and my ſelfe likewiſe with them, that hee might have <hi>Leoniſa</hi> for
himſelfe. Wherewith <hi>Fetala</hi> reſted very well contented. And albeit
I were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at all this, I could not underſtand what they ſayd,
though I knew what they did; neither had I known then the manner of their
ſharings, if <hi>Fetala</hi> had not come unto mee and told mee in
<hi>Italian; Chriſtian</hi> thou art now mine, and put into my hands (as my
Captive) thou being rated at two thouſand Crownes; if thou wilt have thy
libertie, thou muſt give mee 4000, or reſolve here to end thy daies: I then
demanded of him, whether the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Damoſell were his too, he
told mee no, but that <hi>Yſuph</hi> kept her for himſelfe, with intention
to make her turne <hi>Moore,</hi> and then marrie her. And therein he ſayd
true; for one of the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley-ſlaves told mee, that ſate chained on his
bancke at his Oare, and underſtood very well the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> language,
that hee over-heard <hi>Yſuph</hi> and <hi>Fetala</hi> treating therof.
Whereupon I came to my maſter and told him, Sir; if you will bring the
buſineſſe ſo about that the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Damoſell may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
your Captive, I will give you tenth ouſand Crownes in good gold for her
ranſome. He replied, it was not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; but I will acquaint
<hi>Yſuph</hi> with this great ſumme which thou offereſt for her freedome
and perhaps, weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the profit he ſhall reape thereby, hee will alter his
pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,<pb n="125" facs="tcp:58406:66"/>and accept of the ranſome. Hee did ſo; and
then preſently commanded all thoſe of his own Galley to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barke
themſelves as ſoone as poſſibly they could, becauſe he would goe for
<hi>Tripoli</hi> in <hi>Barbarie,</hi> whence he was. And <hi>Yſuph</hi>
likewiſe determined to goe for <hi>Viſerta;</hi> and ſo embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with
the ſelfe ſame haſte as they uſe to doe when they kenne either Galleys
which they feare, or <hi>Veſſells</hi> which they minde to robbe. And that
which moved them to make the more haſte, was; that they ſaw the weather
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to change, with manifeſt ſignes of a ſtorme.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leoniſa</hi> was on land, but not there where I might ſee
her, ſave onely at the time of her embarking, where wee both met at the
ſea-ſide. This her new lover led her by the hand, and ſetting her foot
upon the planke which reached from the land to the Galley; ſhe turned backe
her eyes to looke upon mee, and mine, which never were off from her, ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
wiſhly on her, but with ſuch tenderneſſe; that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing how
ſuch a cloud was caſt before them, that it took away my eye-ſight; and
being robb'd of it, and of my ſenſes, I fell in a ſwound to the ground.
The like they afterwards told mee befell <hi>Leoniſa;</hi> for they ſaw her
fall from the planke into the Sea, and that <hi>Yſuph</hi> ſeapt in after
her, and brought her out thence in his armes. This was told mee by thoſe of
my maſters Galley whereinto they had put me, I not knowing how I came
there.</p>
            <p>But when I came againe to my ſelfe, and ſaw my ſelfe alone
in that Galley, and the other ſteering a contrary courſe, and gone cleane
out of ſight from us, carrying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with them the one halfe of my ſoule,
or (to ſay better) all of it; my heart was clouded anew, and I began anew to
ourſe my misfortune, and called out aloud for death. And ſuch, and ſo
great was the moane and lamentation I made, that my maſters eares being
offended therewith, threatned with a great cudgell, that if I did not hold my
peace, he would ſeverely puniſh me. Whereupon I repreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed my teares,
and ſmothered my fighes, thinking that the<pb n="126" facs="tcp:58406:67"/>violent
reſtraining of them, would breake out the more forceably in ſome one part
or other, and open a doore to let my ſoule out, which I ſo earneſtly
deſired, might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh this my miſerable body. But froward Fortune
not contenting her ſelfe to have put mee into this ſo nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a ſtreight,
tooke a courſe to overthrow all, by taking from me all hope of remedie; for
in an inſtant, the ſtorme wee ſo much feared overtooke us, and the Wind
which blew ſtrongly from the <hi>South,</hi> blew full in the teeth of us;
and began with ſuch furie to re-inforce it ſelfe, that wee were forced to
tacke about, putting the Prow in the Poopes place, ſuffering our Galley to
goe which way the winde would carry her.</p>
            <p>Our Captaines deſigne was, by fetching of boords, to have put
into ſome part of the Iſland for ſhelter; and more particularly, on the
<hi>North</hi> part thereof: but it fell not out anſwerably to his
expectation, but rather quite contrary to what hee had deſigned; for the
winde charged us with ſuch impetuouſneſſe, that all that which we had
ſayled in two dayes, within little more then foureteene houres, we ſaw our
ſelves within two Leagues or thereabout of the ſame Iſland from whence
hee had put forth; And now there was no remedy for hindring our being driven
upon it, and not to runne our ſelves upon ſome ſandy-ſhoare, but
amongſt very high Rocks, which preſented themſelves to our view,
threatning inevitable death to our lives.</p>
            <p>Wee ſaw on the t'one ſide of us, that other our fellow Galley
wherein was <hi>Leoniſa,</hi> and all their <hi>Turkes,</hi> and
Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive-rowers labouring hard with their oares, to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves off as
well as they could from running upon the Rockes. The like did wee in ours, but
with better ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe (it ſhould ſeeme) and greater force and
ſtrength then the other; who being tyred out with their travaile, and
overcome by the ſtiffeneſſe of the winde, and bluſtering ſtorme;
forſaking their Oares, and with them abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning themſelves, they
ſuffered themſelves (wee looking<pb n="127" facs="tcp:58406:67"/>upon them) to fall
amongſt the Rockes, againſt which the Galley daſhing it ſelfe, was
ſplit in a thouſand peeces.</p>
            <p>Night was then drawing on, and ſo great was the cry of thoſe
that gave themſelves for loſt; and the fright of thoſe who in our
Veſſell feared to bee loſt, that not any one of thoſe many things which
our Captaine comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, was either underſtood, or done by them; onely they
did attend the not forgoing of their Oares, plying them ſtill, holding it for
their beſt remedie to turne the Prow to the Winde, and to caſt two Anchors
into the Sea to keep off death for a while, which they held to bee certaine.
And although the feare of dying was generall in all of them, yet in mee was it
quite contrary; for fed with the deceitfull hope of ſeeing her in that other
World, who was ſo lately departed out of this; every minute that the Galley
deferred its drowning, or ſplitting againſt the Rockes, was to mee an age
of a more painefull death. The high ſwollen waves which paſt over the toppe
of our weather beaten Veſſell, and my head; made mee very watchfull to
ſee whether or no, I could eſpie floating upon thoſe crump ſhouldered
billowes, the bodie of unfortunate <hi>Leoniſa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I will not detaine my ſelfe now (O <hi>Mahamut</hi>) in
recounting unto thee peece by peece, the paſſions, the feares, the
anguiſhes, the thoughts, which in that tedious and terrible night I had, and
paſſed; that I may not goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that which before I propounded, and
promiſed, in relating briefly unto thee my misfortune. Suffice it, that they
were ſuch and ſo great, that if death had come to me at that time, hee
needed not to have taken any great paines in taking away my life.</p>
            <p>Day appeared, but with appearance of a farre greater ſtorme then
the former; and wee found that our Veſſell lay riding out at Sea, and a
good waies off from the Rocks. And having deſcried a point of the Iſland,
and perceiving that wee might eaſily double it, both <hi>Turkes,</hi> and
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> began to bee of good cheare, taking new hopes, and new 
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:58406:68"/>hearts unto them, fell anew to their worke, in ſixe
houres we doubled the point, and found the Sea more calme and quiet;
inſomuch, that with a great deale more eaſe, they could handle and uſe
their Oares; and comming under <hi>Lee</hi> of the Iſland, the
<hi>Turkes</hi> leapt out to land, and went to ſee if there were any reliques
remaining of the Galley which the night before fell on the Rockes. But even
then too would not <hi>Fortune</hi> bee ſo favourable unto mee, as to give me
that poore comfort which I hoped to have had of ſeeing <hi>Leoniſa's</hi>
bodie in theſe my armes; which though dead and broken, I would have beene
glad to have ſeene it, for to breake that impoſſibilitie which my
ſtarre had put upon mee, of linking my ſelfe therewith, as my deſires
well deſerved. And therefore entreated one of the <hi>Renega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does</hi> to
diſ-embarke himſelfe to goe in ſearch thereof, and to ſee if the
rolling of the Sea had caſt her on the ſhoare. But (as I told thee) all
this did Heaven deny me; and juſt in that very inſtant the Winde began to
riſe, and the Sea grow rough, ſo that the ſhelter of that Iſland was
not of any benefit at all unto us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fetala</hi> ſeeing this, would not ſtrive againſt
<hi>Fortune,</hi> who had ſo violently perſecuted him; and therefore
comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to right and fit the Galley to beare a little ſayle, &amp; to
turn the Prow to the Sea-ward, and the Poope to the Wind-ward; and he
himſelfe taking charge of the Rudder, ſate at the helme, ſuffering her to
runne through the wide Sea; being well aſſured that no impediment would
croſſe its courſe: The Oares bare themſelves very eeven, being ſeated
very orderly on their bankes, and all the reſt of the company got them into
the Hold underneath the Hatches, ſo that there was not a man to bee ſeene
on the Deck, ſave the Maſter; who for his more ſafety, cauſed
himſelfe to be bound faſt to his ſeate, giving thence direction to the
Rowers, for the better governing and guiding of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell; which made
its way with that ſwiftneſſe, that in three dayes, and three nights,
paſſing in ſight of <hi>Trapana,</hi>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:58406:68"/>of
<hi>Melazo,</hi> and <hi>Palermo,</hi> ſhe imboked by the <hi>Pharos</hi> of
<hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cina,</hi> to the wonderfull feare of thoſe that were in her, and of
thoſe likewiſe which behold them on the land.</p>
            <p>In fine, not to bee tedious in recounting unto thee the
terribleneſſe of this tempeſt, which is beyond all expreſſion, I
ſay; that being weary, hungry, and tyred out with ſuch a large compaſſe
about, as was the rounding of almoſt all the whole Iſland of
<hi>Sicily,</hi> wee arrived at <hi>Tripoli</hi> in <hi>Barbarie;</hi> where my
maſter (before that he had reckoned with his <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant-men,</hi> ſhared
out the ſpoiles, and given that unto them which was their due, and a fifth to
the King, as the cuſtome is;) fell ſicke of a Plurſiee, accompanied with
a burning Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in that violent manner, that within three dayes it ſent him
packing to hell.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Tripoli</hi> ſeazed preſently upon all his
goods; and the <hi>Alacade de los muertos,</hi> which is an Office of Inquirie
concerning the dead, ſubſtituted by the great <hi>Turke;</hi> who as you
know, is heire to thoſe that are his naturall Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects after their deaths.
Theſe two poſſeſſed themſelves of all my Maſter <hi>Fetala's</hi>
wealth, and I fell into the hands of him who was the <hi>Viceroy</hi> of
<hi>Tripoli;</hi> and within fifteen daies after he received his Patent for
<hi>Cyprus,</hi> with whom (you ſee) I am come hither, but without any
intention at all to ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome my ſelfe, though he hath often told me that I
ſhould if I would, and wondred why I did not do it all this while, being (as
<hi>Fetala's</hi> Souldiers told him) a principall perſon, and a man of good
meanes in his owne Countrey. But I was ſo far from entertaining that motion,
that I told him, that they had miſ-informed him of my fortunes. And if thou
wilt <hi>(Mahamut)</hi> that I acquaint thee truely with what I thinke; Know
thou then, that I will never returne backe againe to that place, where I can no
waies receive any comfort, and where <hi>Leoniſa's</hi> death will in part,
if not who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bee imputed unto mee. What pleaſure then can I take, either
there, or here; in this my thraldome, though I muſt confeſſe, that the
remembrance of her loſſe is more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous<pb n="130" facs="tcp:58406:69"/>unto meethen
a thouſand Captivities. And if it bee true, that continuall ſorrowes,
muſt of force have an end, or end him who ſuffers them; mine cannot
chooſe but doe it, for I am reſolved to give them ſuch a looſe reine,
that within a few dayes, they ſhall give an end to this my miſerable life,
which I hold ſo much againſt my will.</p>
            <p>This (O my brother <hi>Mahamut</hi>) is my ſad ſucceſſe;
This is the cauſe of theſe my ſighes and teares; Behold now and
conſider, if this bee not ſufficient for to hale the one from out the
deepeſt bottome of my bowels, and to exhale the other from out my afflicted
and tormented bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome? <hi>Leoniſa</hi> is dead, and with her my hope; and
though that which I had (ſhe living) hung but by a ſmall and ſlender
thread; yet, yet, and with this yet, his tongue clave ſo cloſe to the roofe
of his mouth, that he could not ſpeake one word more, nor refraine from
weeping, whoſe teares, drop after drop, one overtaking another, trickled
downe his face in ſuch abundance, that the ground was all wet whereon they
fell. <hi>Mahamut,</hi> accompanied thoſe with his teares.</p>
            <p>But this <hi>Paroſiſme</hi> being over-paſt, cauſed by
relating this ſad ſtory, and calling to minde his loſt <hi>Leoniſa;
Mahamut</hi> was very willing, and withall went about to comfort him all that
he could, with as good terms and perſwaſions as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly he could
deuiſe. But <hi>Ricardo</hi> did cut him ſhort of tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him.</p>
            <p>That which thou art (my deare friend) to do, is; that thou wilt
adviſe me, what courſe I ſhall take for to fall into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace with my
maſter, and with all thoſe with whom I ſhall converſe, that being hated
and abhorred by him, and by them; the one and the other might ill entreate me,
and perſecute me in ſuch ſort, that adding ſorrow to ſorrow, I may
ſpeedily obtain that which I ſo earneſtly deſire, which is, to end my
life.</p>
            <p>Now I finde that to bee true (ſayd <hi>Mahamut</hi>) which is
commonly ſpoken; <hi>Lo queſe ſabe ſentir, ſe ſabe dezir.</hi> 
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:58406:69"/>He that knowes his griefe, knows how to ſpeak it; though
ſometimes it ſo happeneth that it maketh the tongue dumbe. But howſoever
it bee, (whether thy ſorrowes reach to thy words, or thy words out goe thy
ſorrowes) thou ſhalt ever <hi>(Ricardo)</hi> finde me thy true friend,
either for aſſiſtance, or for counſaile. For albeit my few yeares, and
the inconſideratneſſe which I have committed, in putting my ſelfe into
this habit, may cry out againſt mee that of neither of theſe two things
which I offer thee, thou mayſt have any confidence, or hope; yet will I
endeavour to the utmoſt of my power, that this ſuſpition may not prove
true, nor any ſuch opinion be held for certaine. And albeit thou wilt not
neither bee adviſed, nor aſſiſted by me, yet wil I not leave off doing
that which ſhall be fitting and convenient for thee; as good Phiſitians
uſe to deale with their ſicke patients, who doe not give them that which
they crave, but what they thinke convenient for them to have.</p>
            <p>There is not any in all this Citie, that can doe, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
more then the <hi>Cadi</hi> my Maſter; no, not even thine, (who comes to bee
<hi>Viceroy</hi> thereof) is ſo powerfull as hee. This being ſo as it is, I
dare be bold to ſay, that I am the man that can doe moſt in this Citie,
becauſe I can doe whatſoever I will with my Maſter. I ſpeake this,
becauſe it may bee I ſhall ſo plot the buſineſſe with him, and
bring it ſo handſomely about, that thou mayſt come to bee his, and being
in my company, time will teach us that which we are to doe, as well for to
comfort thee, if thou wilt or canſt bee comforted; as likewiſe for my
ſelfe to get out of this, to a better life; or at leaſt, to ſome place
where it may be more ſafe when I leave this. I kindly thanke you
<hi>(Mahamut)</hi> replied <hi>Ricardo</hi> for your proffered friendſhippe,
though ſure I am, that when thou haſt done all thou canſt do, thou
canſt not do any thing that can do me any good.</p>
            <p>But let us now give over this diſcourſe, and make to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the
Tents; for if my eye-ſight deceive me not; I ſee<pb n="134" facs="tcp:58406:70"/>a
great preſſe of people comming out of the Citie, and doubtleſſe it is
the old <hi>Viceroy,</hi> who comes forth into the field for to give place unto
my Maſter, that hee may enter the Citie, to make his <hi>Reſidence.</hi> It
is even ſo, ſayd <hi>Mahamut,</hi> come along with mee <hi>Ricardo,</hi>
and thou ſhalt ſee the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies wherewith they receive him, for I know
thou wilt take pleaſure in ſeing them. With a very good will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<hi>Ricardo;</hi> for peradventure I ſhall have need of thee; if happily the
<hi>Guardian</hi> of my Maſters Captives ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to meet with mee,
who is a <hi>Renegaao,</hi> and by birth of <hi>Corſo,</hi> but of no very
pittifull and tender bowels.</p>
            <p>Here they left off any farther communication, and came to the
Tents juſt at that very inſtant as the old <hi>Baſhawe</hi> came thither;
and the new one came forth to receive him at the doore of the Tent. <hi>Ali
Baſhaw,</hi> (for ſo was he called who left the government) came accompaied
with all the <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> being the ordinary garriſon Souldiers in
<hi>Nicoſia,</hi> ever ſince the <hi>Turkes</hi> were maſters of it,
being to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of five hundered. They came in two Wings or Files; the one
with their Muskers, and the other with naked <hi>Simyters.</hi> They came to
the Tent of the new <hi>Baſhaw Hazan,</hi> rounding it from one ſide at the
doore thereof, till they met at the other; where <hi>Ali Baſhaw</hi> bowing
his body, made a lowly reverence to <hi>Hazan;</hi> and he with a leſſe
enclining himſelfe re-ſaluted him.</p>
            <p>This done <hi>Ali</hi> proſently entred into <hi>Hazan's</hi>
Pavillion, where the <hi>Turkes</hi> preſently mounted him upon a proud
Horſe, with wondrous rich furniture; and conducting him round about the
Tents, and a good part of the field, clamouring out with loud acclamations in
their owne language, Long live <hi>Solyman Sultan,</hi> and <hi>Hazan
Baſhaw</hi> in his name: They repeated this very often, re-inforcing their
voices and vociferations, and then preſently returned back againe to the
Tent, where <hi>Ali Baſhaw</hi> remained; who with the <hi>Cadi</hi> and
<hi>Hazan,</hi> ſhut themſelves up cloſe for the ſpace of one hour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> all alone: <hi>Mahamut</hi> then told
<hi>Ricardo,</hi>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:58406:70"/>that they had thus retyred themſelves,
to treat of that which was fit to be done in the Citie, touching ſuch
buſineſſes as were commenced, but not finiſhed by <hi>Ali.</hi> Within
a little while after the <hi>Cadi</hi> came forth to the doore of the Tent, and
ſayd with aloud voice in the <hi>Turkiſh, Arabick,</hi> and <hi>Greeke</hi>
tongue; That all they who would enter to crave juſtice, or to lay any other
matter againſt <hi>Ali Baſhaw,</hi> might have free entrance: for there was
<hi>Hazan Baſhaw,</hi> whom the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> hath ſent for
<hi>Viceroy</hi> of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> who would doe them all right and
juſtice. This licenſe being given, the <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizaries</hi> left the doore
of the Tent diſ-occupied, and gave way to ſuch as would enter in;
<hi>Mahamut</hi> wrought <hi>Ricardo</hi> to goe in with him, who for that they
were <hi>Hazans</hi> ſlaves, had without any hinderance free acceſſe
thereunto.</p>
            <p>There entred to crave juſtice, ſome
<hi>Greeke-Chriſtians,</hi> and ſome <hi>Turkes,</hi> but all of them
charging him with ſuch tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling things, and of ſo ſmall moment; that the
<hi>Cadi</hi> diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moſt of them, without giving a Copie to the
Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, without further examination, demaunds, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers. For all
cauſes, unleſſe they be matrimoniall, are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched in an inſtant,
more dy the judgement of a good underſtanding man, then the quercks of Law.
And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt theſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> (if they be ſo in this particular)
the <hi>Cadi</hi> is the competent iudge of all Cauſes, who doth abbre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate
them, and determine them in the turning of a hand; and forthwith pronounceth
ſentence without any appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling therefro, to any other

            </p>
            <p>In this interim, entred in a <hi>Chauz,</hi> which is as it were
an <hi>Alquazil,</hi> and ſayd; That there was a <hi>lew</hi> at the Tent
doore, who had brought to bee ſold a moſt fayre and beautifull
<hi>Chriſtian;</hi> the <hi>Cadi</hi> commanded that they ſhould bid him

ſhe ſurpaſſed all the <hi>Affrican</hi> women; yea, though even thoſe
of <hi>Argier's</hi> ſhould have preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves there with all
their Pearles and rich embroyderies. She came in, having her face covered with
a ſcarfe of <hi>Crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Taffata;</hi> about the ſmalls of her legges
(which diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themſelves) there appeared two golden chaines of pure
burniſht gold; and on her armes, which likewiſe through a ſmocke of
Cendall, or thinne <hi>Taffata-Sarcenet,</hi> were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant, and ſhewed
themſelves to the ſearching curious eyes of the beholders; ſhe ware two
bracelets of gold, wherein were ſet ſcatteringly here and there, many fayre
Pearles and precious Stones. In concluſion the faſhion of her cloathes, and
all other habiliments about her were ſuch, that ſhe preſented her ſelfe
before them, moſt richly and gorgeouſly attyred.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cadi,</hi> and the other two <hi>Baſhaw's</hi> upon the
very firſt ſight of her, being mightily taken; before any other thing was
ſayd or queſtioned by them, they willed the <hi>Iew,</hi> that hee ſhould
take the ſcarfe from off the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> face; Hee did ſo, and
withall did diſcover ſuch a ſplendour, and ſuch a beautifull
countenance, as did dazle the eyes, and glad the hearts of all the ſtanders
by: As the Sunne ſcarfed with clouds, after much darkneſſe, offers it
ſelfe to the eyes of thoſe who long for its deſired preſence; ſuch,
and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then ſuch was the beautie of this Captived
<hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi> in this her braverie and gallantry.</p>
            <p>But he, on whom this wonderfull light which was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
wrought the greateſt and deepeſt impreſſion, was this our ſorrowfull
<hi>Ricardo,</hi> as one who better than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knew her, ſince that
ſhee was his cruell and beloved <hi>Leoniſa,</hi> who ſo often and with
ſo many teares, had by him been reputed and deplored for dead. With the
ſodaine and unexpected ſight of the ſingular beautie of this
<hi>Chriſtian,</hi> the heart of <hi>Ali</hi> was wounded and captivated; and
in the ſame degree, and with the ſelfe ſame wound <hi>Hazan</hi> found
himſelfe toucht; the <hi>Cadi</hi> himſelfe not being exempted 
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:58406:71"/>from this amorous wound, who more perplexed than both the
other, knew not how to remove his eyes from looking on thoſe fayrer lights of
<hi>Leoniſa.</hi> And for to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deare the great and powerfull force of
<hi>Love;</hi> I would have thee to take notice, that at one and the ſame
inſtant there was bred in the hearts of all theſe three, one and the ſame
(as they flattered themſelves) firme hope of obtaining and enjoying her. And
therefore without queſtioning how, where, and when the <hi>Iew</hi> came by
her, they onely asked him what hee would take for her? The covetous
<hi>Iew</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, two thouſand Crownes. But hee had ſcarce ſet
the priſe, but that <hi>Ali Baſhaw</hi> ſayd unto him, that he would give
him ſo much for her; and that hee would goe to his Tent, and preſently
bring him his money.</p>

Baſhaw,</hi> who was minded that he ſhould not have her, though therein he
ſhould hazzard his life; ſayd, I likewiſe will give for her thoſe two
thouſand Crownes which the <hi>Iew</hi> demaundeth; yet would I neither give
ſo much, neither ſet my ſelfe to croſſe <hi>Ali</hi> herein, or what
he hath offered, did not that inforce me thereunto; which hee himſelfe
ſhall confeſſe is reaſon, and doth obliedge and force mee to doe as I
doe, and this it is; That this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile ſlave appertaineth not to either of
us two, but onely to the <hi>Grand-Signior;</hi> and therefore I ſay, that in
his name I buy her: Now let us ſee who dare bee ſo bold as to offer to take
her from mee.</p>
            <p>Marry that dare I, replied <hi>Ali;</hi> becauſe for the ſelfe
ſame end and purpoſe doe I buy her: and it appertaineth more eſpecially
unto mee, to tender this preſent to the <hi>Grand-Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior,</hi> in regard of
the conveniencie that I have to convey her forthwith to
<hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> carrying her along with me, that thereby I may gaine
the good will of the <hi>Grand-Signior.</hi> For I being now a man (as thou now
<hi>Hazan</hi> ſeeſt) without any charge or command, I had need ſeek out
ſome meanes to procure it, wherein thou art ſurely ſetled for three
years, ſince that this is the very firſt day in which thou beginneſt 
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:58406:72"/>to beare rule, and to governe this rich kingdome of
<hi>Cyprus.</hi> And therefore, as well for theſe reaſons, as that I was
the firſt that offered the propounded priſe for her; it ſtands with all
reaſon (O <hi>Hazan</hi>) that thou leave her unto mee. Nay rather it is more
fitting, and will bee better taken at my hands (replied <hi>Hazan</hi>) to
procure her and ſend her to the <hi>Grand Signior;</hi> ſince that I doe it
without being moved thereunto out of mine owne private intereſt, or
expectan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of profit. And whereas you alleadge the commodiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and
conveniencie of carrying her along with you; I will ſet forth a Galley of
mine owne well armed, putting thereinto men of mine owne, ſome ſervants,
ſome ſlaves, which ſhall ſerve for her Convoy, and goe along with her.
At theſe words <hi>Ali's</hi> bloud began to riſe, and riſing upon his
feet, hee layd his hand on his <hi>Cimyter,</hi> ſaying; <hi>Hazan,</hi> my
intentions being the ſame, for the preſenting and carrying of this
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> to the <hi>Grand-Signior,</hi> and I having beene the
firſt chapman that drave the bargaine; it is grounded upon all reaſon and
juſtice, that thou leave her unto mee; and if thou ſhouldſt but thinke to
carry her from mee, this <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myter</hi> which I lay my hand on ſhall
defend my right, and chaſtiſe thy preſumption.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cadi,</hi> who was attentive to all that paſt betweene
them, and burned no leſſe in <hi>Loves</hi> flames then the other two,
fearing leaſt hee might goe without the <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> bethought
himſelfe how hee might quench this great fire which was kindled betweene
them; and withall, to get the Captive into his owne cuſtody, without giving
any the leaſt ſuſpicion of his damnable intention. And therefore riſing
up, he interpoſed himſelfe betweene them, and ſaid; <hi>Hazan,</hi> and
<hi>Ali,</hi> let mee entreat you both to be quiet, and lay aſide theſe
your differences; and I doubt not but I ſhall bee able to compoſe them in
ſuch ſort, that both of you may effect your intentions, and the
<hi>Grand-Signior</hi> be (as you deſire) well ſerved by you.</p>
            <p>To theſe words of the <hi>Cadi,</hi> they preſently ſhewed
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves<pb n="137" facs="tcp:58406:72"/>o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bedient, and had hee commanded them a
greater matter, they would have done it; (ſo great is the reſpect which
thoſe of that ſect beare to his gray haires.) The <hi>Cadi</hi> then
proſecuting what hee had begun in this manner.</p>
            <p>Thou <hi>Ali</hi> ſayeſt, that thou wouldſt have this
Chriſtian for the <hi>Grand-Signior;</hi> and <hi>Hazan</hi> he ſayes the
like: Thou alleageſt, that thou waſt the firſt in offering the demaunded
price for her, and therefore ſhe ought to bee thine. <hi>Hazan</hi>
contradicts thee in this; and though hee doth not put his argument ſo home to
the pinching point; yet I finde it is the ſame as thine is; that is, the
ſame intention, which without all doubt was hatched as ſoone as thine was,
in his deſire and willingneſſe to buy the Slave for the ſame effect;
onely thou gotſt the ſtart of him, in having firſt declared thy ſelfe,
yet ought not this to bee a cauſe that hee ſhould abſolutely and wholy be
defrauded and fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of his good deſire. And therefore in my opinion,
it ſhall not bee amiſſe to accord this buſineſſe betweene you, in
this forme and manner following; That both of you ſhall have equall
interreſt in this Slave, and ſince that the uſe of her is to bee at the
will and pleaſure of the <hi>Grand-Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior,</hi> for whom ſhe is bought,
it belongeth unto him to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of her. In the meane while, you
<hi>Hazan</hi> ſhall pay two thouſand Crownes; and <hi>Ali</hi> ſhall lay
downe the other two thouſand, and the Captive ſhall remaine in my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
to the end, that in both your names I may ſend her to
<hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> that neither of you might remaine unrewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and
can certifie (as being an eye witneſſe) your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe to gratifie
the <hi>Grand-Signior;</hi> and therefore offer my ſelfe to ſend her
thither at my coſt and charge, with that authority and decencie which is due
to him, to whom ſhe is ſent. Writing to the <hi>Grand-Signior,</hi>
acquainting him with all that which paſſed here, and your readineſſe to
do him this ſervice.</p>
            <p>Theſe two enamoured <hi>Turkes,</hi> neither knew, nor could,
nor would contradict him; each of them forming and<pb n="138" facs="tcp:58406:73"/>imagining in his minde a hope (though doubtfull) of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to
themſelves the attaining to the end of their infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med deſires.
<hi>Hazan,</hi> who was to continue <hi>Viceroy</hi> of <hi>Cyprus,</hi>
thought upon giving great gifts to the <hi>Cadi,</hi> that being thereby
overcome and obliged, he ſhould deliver up unto him the Captive. And
<hi>Ali</hi> he imagined to do ſome ſuch act as ſhould aſſure the
obtaining of what he deſired, and each of them holding his owne deſigne the
beſt, and the ſureſt; they eaſily condiſcended to what the
<hi>Cadi</hi> had propounded, and with a joynt conſent both of them delivered
her up preſently unto him, and made each of them preſent pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the
<hi>Iew</hi> 1000 Crownes a peece: But the <hi>Iew</hi> ſayd hee would not
part with her upon thoſe tearmes, if they meant to have into the bargaine her
wearing apparrell, and her jewels, which hee valewed at 1000 Crownes more. And
in very deed they could be little leſſe worth, becauſe in her haires
which partly hung diſhevell'd on her ſhoulders, and partly knit up in
curious knots on her fore-head, there appeared ſome ropes of pearles, which
very gracefully were interwoven with them. The bracelet about her armes, and
above her ancles in the ſmall of the legge were likewiſe full of great
pearles; her rayment throughout was very rich, and theron a mantle after the
Mooriſh manner of greene Sattin deepely fringed and embroydered with
gold.</p>
            <p>In a word, it ſeemed to all that were there preſent, that the
<hi>Iew</hi> had undervalued the attyring of her. And the <hi>Cadi,</hi> that
hee might not ſhew himſelfe leſſe liberall then the two
<hi>Baſhaw's,</hi> told him, hee would pay him thoſe thouſand Crownes,
becauſe hee would have her to be preſented in the ſame dreſſe (which
ſhe was now in) to the <hi>Grand-Signior.</hi> The two competitors did
approve very well of it, each of them beleeving that all ſhould fall out as
they would have it.</p>
            <p>I want now words ſignificant enough to tell you what
<hi>Ricardo</hi> thought, in ſeeing his ſoule ſet out thus to 
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:58406:73"/>open ſale; and thoſe thoughts which then came into his
head, and thoſe feares which ſodainely ſurprized him; when as he ſaw
that his finding of his beloved Pledge was to loſe her the more; He knew not
for a while, whether he were ſleeping or waking, not beleeving his owne eyes,
in giving credit to that which they had ſeene. For it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med unto him a
thing impoſſible, that they ſhould ſee ſo unexpectedly before them,
thoſe eyes of hers which hee had (not long ſince) given to bee ſhut up in
eternall darkeneſſe.</p>
            <p>When hee ſaw that this was no phantaſma or dreame, but a reall
truth; hee came to his friendly <hi>Mahamut,</hi> and whiſpering him in the
care, ſayd ſoftly unto him; Friend, doſt not thou know her? Not I ſayd
<hi>Mahamut;</hi> Then would I have thee know, (replied <hi>Ricardo</hi>) that
it is <hi>Leoniſa:</hi> How (anſwered <hi>Mahamut</hi>) what is that
<hi>Ricardo,</hi> thou ſayeſt? That (ſayd <hi>Ricardo</hi>) which thou
haſt already heard. Hold thy peace then, and doe not diſcover her, replied
<hi>Mahamut,</hi> for <hi>Fortune</hi> goes now ſo ordering the
buſineſſe, that thou ſhalt finde her good and proſperous, ſince
that ſhee is in my Maſters power. Doſt thou thinke it fit, ſayd
<hi>Ricardo,</hi> that I goe and put my ſelfe in ſome ſuch place where I
may bee ſeene by her? No, by no meanes, replied <hi>Mahamut;</hi> leaſt
ſhee ſhould put you, or you her into ſome ſodaine paſſion; and have
a great care that you doe not give any the leaſt ſigne or token that you
know her, or that ever you had ſeen her; for if you ſhould do ſo, it
might redound much to the prejudice of my deſigne, if not utterly overthrow
it. I will follow your adviſe, anſwered <hi>Ricardo,</hi> and ſo went his
way, leaving the place, leaſt his eyes might encounter with thoſe of
<hi>Leoniſa;</hi> who held hers all the while that this paſſed nay led to
the ground, trilling ſome teares downe from them.</p>
            <p>Shee being thus (as you have heard) rendred up unto the
<hi>Cadi,</hi> he came unto her, and laying hands on her, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered her unto
<hi>Mahamut,</hi> commanding him to carry her<pb n="140" facs="tcp:58406:74"/>to the Citie,
with charge to deliver her to his Lady <hi>Halima;</hi> and to tell her
withall, that ſhe ſhould uſe and intreat her well, as being the ſlave
of the <hi>Grand-Signior. Mahamut</hi> did ſo, and left <hi>Ricardo</hi> all
alone, who with his eyes went fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing this his Star, till it was wholy taken
out of his ſight, and covered as it were with a cloud from him by the walls
of <hi>Nicoſia.</hi> Having loſt her, hee goes to looke out the
<hi>Iew,</hi> findes him; and comming civilly unto him, askt him where he had
bought this Captive <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and how, and in what manner ſhee
came into his hand. The <hi>Iew</hi> made him anſwer, that hee lighted on her
in the Iſland of <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalea;</hi> and that he bought her of certaine
<hi>Turkes,</hi> whoſe Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky had ſuffered wrack, being ſplit there
againſt the Rocks. And being willing to have gone on in the proſecution of
what hee had begun, it received interruption, and was wholy broken off by one
that came from the <hi>Baſhaw's,</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the <hi>Iew</hi> that he
muſt come away preſently unto them who had purpoſely ſent for him; that
they might demand that of him, which <hi>Ricardo</hi> was ſo deſirous to
know, and thereupon he abruptly tooke his leave.</p>
            <p>In the way, which was betweene the Tents and the Towne,
<hi>Mahamut</hi> tooke occaſion to aske <hi>Leoniſa</hi> (ſpeaking unto
her in <hi>Italian</hi>) whence ſhee was, and of what place? Who made him
anſwer, that ſhee was of the Citie of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pana:</hi> Then
<hi>Mahamut</hi> demanded againe of her, whether ſhe did know in that Citie,
a rich and noble Gentleman, called <hi>Ricardo?</hi> As her hearing him named,
<hi>Leoniſa</hi> fetcht a deepe ſighe, ſaying; Too too well to my hurt.
How, to your hurt? replied <hi>Mahamut.</hi> Becauſe hee knew me (ſayd
<hi>Leoniſa</hi>) to his owne, and my unhappineſſe. But I pray tell mee
(quoth <hi>Mahamut</hi>) Did you know likewiſe in the fayd Citie another
Gentleman of a gentile diſpoſition, the Sonne of very rich Parents, and
himſelfe in his owne perſon very valiant, very liberall, and very
diſcreet, called <hi>Cornelio?</hi> I likewiſe know him (ſayd
<hi>Leoniſa</hi>) and I may ſay much more to my hurt than
<hi>Ricardo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:58406:74"/>But I pray Sir who are you, who know theſe
two, and aske mee of them? I am (ſayd <hi>Mahamut</hi>) of <hi>Palermo,</hi>
and by various accidents in this diſguiſe and different habite from that
which I was wont to weare. I know them paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing well, for it is not many
dayes ſince that they were both in my power. For certaine <hi>Moores</hi> of
<hi>Tripoli</hi> in <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> had taken <hi>Cornelio</hi> Captive, and
ſold him to a <hi>Turke,</hi> who brought him to this Iſland, whether he
came with Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, (for hee is a Merchant of <hi>Rhodes</hi>) who had
truſted <hi>Cornelio</hi> with all his goods. And hee will keepe them well,
(ſayd <hi>Leoniſa</hi>) becauſe he knows ſo well to keepe his own.</p>
            <p>But tell mee Sir, how, or with whom <hi>Ricardo</hi> came to this
Iſland? Marry hee came (anſwered <hi>Mahamus</hi>) with a Pyrate who tooke
him priſoner in a Garden neare the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoare of <hi>Trapana;</hi> and
that together with him, hee had Captivated a Damoſell, but I could never get
him to tell me her name. He abode here ſome few daies with his Maſter, who
was to goe to viſit <hi>Mahomets</hi> Sepulchre, which is in the Citie of
<hi>Almedina:</hi> But juſt at the time of his departure, <hi>Ricardo</hi>
fell ſo extreame ſicke, that his Maſter left him with me (for that I was
his Countrey-man,) to the end, that I might uſe all the beſt meanes for his
recoverie, and take care and charge of him, till his returne; and in caſe
that hee did not returne hither, that I ſhould ſend him unto him to
<hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> whereof he would advertiſe me when he came
thither.</p>
            <p>But Heaven had otherwiſe ordered it, ſince that unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
<hi>Ricardo</hi> without having any accident or ſimptome of a dangerous
ſickneſſe, within a few dayes ended thoſe of his life; making often
mention of one <hi>Leoniſa,</hi> whom (as himſelfe told me) hee loved more
then his owne life, and was as deare unto him, if not dearer then his owne
ſoule. Which <hi>Leoniſa</hi> (as he at large related unto mee) ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
ſhipwrack at the Iſland of <hi>Pantanlea,</hi> the Galley where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhee
was, being ſplit upon the Rockes, and her ſelfe drowned, Whoſe death
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee continually lamented, and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:58406:75"/>with much weeping bewayled, till that his mourning had
brought him to breath his laſt; for I perceived no ſickneſſe at all in
him in his bodie, but great ſhewes of griefe and ſorrow in his ſoule.</p>
            <p>Tell mee (Sir) replie <hi>Leoniſa;</hi> this other young man
whom you ſpeake off, in thoſe his diſcourſes which hee had with you;
which (for that you were of his owne Countrey) could not but be very many, did
he not at any time ſpeake of <hi>Leoniſa?</hi> And did he tell you, how
ſhee, and <hi>Ricardo</hi> were made Captives, and the whole manner of it?
Speake of her (ſayd <hi>Mahamut</hi>) yes a thouſand, and a thouſand
times; and asked mee many a time and oft, whether any Chriſtian of this name
had of late beene brought to this Iſland, and with ſuch and ſuch markes
and tokens, and how glad hee would bee to heare any tydings of her, that he
might ranſome her. And withall I muſt tell you, that hee had told his
Maſter, and in telling, made him beleeve that ſhee was not ſo rich as he
tooke her to bee; and for that he had enjoyed her, he might now make the
leſſe rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning of her; and that if three or foure hundred Crowns would
purchaſe her freedome, he would willingly give ſo much for her, becauſe
heretofore he had borne ſome good will and affection towards her.</p>
            <p>Very little (ſayd <hi>Leoniſa</hi>) muſt that his affection
be which would not goe beyond foure hundred Crownes; But <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardo</hi> is
more liberall, more valiant, more generous, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious, then to make ſo
poore an offer, for that which hee prized at ſo high a valew. God pardon the
party that was the cauſe of his death; for it was I that am that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
woman whom hee bewayled for dead; and God knowes, if I ſhould not bee glad
with all my heart that hee were alive, that I might requite his kindneſſe,
and that hee might ſee how ſenſible I ſhould be of his misfortune, who
hath ſorrowed ſo much for mine.</p>
            <p>I Sir (as I have already told you) am ſhee, who is as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
beloved of <hi>Cornelio,</hi> as I was greatly bewayled of <hi>Ricardo;</hi> 
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:58406:75"/>She, who by very many and various chances am come to this
miſerable eſtate wherin I now find my ſelf; and though it bee ſo
dangerous (as you ſee) yet have I alwaies by Heavens gracious
aſſiſtance, kept mine honour entire and untoucht, wherewith in this my
miſery I live contented. But now (woe is mee) neither doe I know where I am,
nor who is my Maſter, nor whether my contrarious fates will hurrie mee.
Wherefore I beſeech you Sir, by that bloud which you have in you of a
Chriſtian, that you will give mee your beſt counſaile and adviſe in
theſe my troubles; which for that they have beene many, though they have made
mee looke about and bee ſomewhat the more warie and circumſpect; yet
notwithſtanding, ſuch and ſo many every moment came upon mee, that I knew
not well how to prevent and withſtand them.</p>
            <p>Whereunto <hi>Mahamut</hi> anſwered, that he would doe all
whatſoever he was able to doe, in ſerving, adviſing, and aſſiſting
her with his beſt wit and ſtrength. And then did hee advertiſe her of the
difference betweene the two <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw's</hi> for her ſake, and how that
ſhe now remained in the power of the <hi>Cadi</hi> his Maſter, for the
conveying and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting her to the great <hi>Turke, Selim,</hi> at
<hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> But ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then this ſhould take effect, he hoped
in the true God, in whom hee beleeved, (though a bad Chriſtian) that he would
diſpoſe otherwiſe of her; adviſing her withall, that by bearing her
ſelfe fayrely, ſhe ſhould work and inſinuate her ſelfe into
<hi>Halima's</hi> favour and good opinion, Wife to the <hi>Cadi</hi> his
Maſter, in whoſe power ſhe was to remaine till they ſhould ſend her
to <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> acquainting her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, with <hi>Halima's</hi>
conditions and qualities; and beſides theſe, told her many other things
which might make much for her good, holding talke and diſcourſe with her
all the way, till he had brought her to, and left her in the <hi>Cadi's</hi>
houſe, and in the power of <hi>Halima,</hi> to whom hee delivered his
Maſters meſſage. The <hi>Moore,</hi> for that ſhe ſaw ſhe was ſo
well clad, and ſo beautifull, gave her a very kinde and<pb n="144" facs="tcp:58406:76"/>friendly welcome. <hi>Mahamut</hi> having rendred up his charge into
<hi>Halima's</hi> hands, returned back to the Tents, to recount unto
<hi>Ricardo</hi> what had paſſed betwixt himſelfe, and
<hi>Leoniſa;</hi> and meeting with him, told him all, point by point, from
the beginning to the ending. But when I came to tell him how ſorrowfull
<hi>Leoniſa</hi> was, when I ſignified unto her, that hee was dead, the
water ſtood in his eyes: I told him how I had feigned that counterfeit
ſtory of <hi>Cornelio's</hi> being a Captive, to ſee how ſhe would take
it; I acquainted him with her coldneſſe to <hi>Cornelio,</hi> and the bad
conceit ſhe had of him for his undervaluing her. All which was as a
ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne cordiall to <hi>Ricardo's</hi> afflicted heart; Who ſayd unto
<hi>Mahamut.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There comes now into my minde (friend <hi>Mahamut</hi>) a tale
which my Father told mee, who (you know) how curious hee was; and have heard (I
am ſure) what great honour the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth did him,
whom he ſtill ſerv'd in honourable places in his Warres: I tell you that he
told me, that when the Emperour was at the Siege of <hi>Tunez</hi> and tooke
it, together with the Fort <hi>Goleta;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one day in the field in his
Tent, they preſented unto him a <hi>Moore,</hi> as a ſingular rarity for
her beauty; and that at that very time wherein they preſented her unto him,
entred in certaine beames of the Sunne at the one ſide of the Tent, and
reſted on the haires of the <hi>Moore,</hi> which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ſtand in
competion with thoſe of the Sunne, being betweene red, and yellow,
reſembling the collour of golden Wyars; A rare and ſtrange thing amongſt
the <hi>Moores,</hi> with whom your blacke haires are in greateſt eſteeme
and requeſt. He told mee likewiſe, that on that occaſion, there were in
the Tent, amongſt many other, two <hi>Spaniſh</hi> gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, both very
diſcreet, and both Poets; the one of <hi>Anda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luzia,</hi> the other of
<hi>Catalunia.</hi> The former having taken a view of her, vented certaine
verſes, which they call <hi>Coplas,</hi> ending in thime; but being at a
ſtand when hee had ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered five of his verſes; the other gentleman
(ſeeing him<pb n="145" facs="tcp:58406:76"/>ſticke, and that hee could goe no further
to make an end of what hee had begunne, for want of words which on the
ſuddaine did not offer themſelves to his liking,) who ſtood cloſe by
him, and had heard theſe his Verſes, went preſently on where hee left,
adding inſtantly five other to the former. And this preſented it ſelfe
unto my memorie, when I ſaw that moſt beautifull <hi>Leoniſa</hi> enter
the <hi>Baſhaw's</hi> Tent; not onely out ſhining the beames of the Sunne,
ſhould they have lighted on her, but even Heaven it ſelfe, with all it's
ſtarres.</p>
            <p>Hold (ſayd <hi>Mahamut</hi>) no more, leaſt (friend
<hi>Ricardo</hi>) thy tongue runne riot, for at every word thou uttereſt, I
am afrayd thou wilt paſſe ſo farre beyond the bounds, of not onely
reaſon, but religion, in the praiſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of thy fayre
<hi>Leoniſa,</hi> that leaving to ſeeme a Chriſtian, thou wilt bee taken
for a Gentile. Let mee heare thoſe verſes or Coplas,, or what elſe you
pleaſe to call them, that wee may afterwards talke of other things that may
bee more pleaſing, and perhaps more profitable. In good time (ſayd
<hi>Ricardo</hi>) but let mee once againe advertiſe thee that the
<hi>Andaluz</hi> vented the firſt five verſes, and the <hi>Catalan</hi> the
other five, both <hi>extempore,</hi> and theſe they bee.</p>

            </sp>
            <p>I like them well (ſayd <hi>Mahamut</hi>) but much better (my
<hi>Ricardo</hi>) that you are in this good humour of repeating 
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:58406:77"/>verſes, becauſe the ſaying or making of them
requireth the mindes of men that are diſapaſſionated, Men like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
uſe (replyed <hi>Ricardo</hi>) to wayle over Hearſes, as to ſing
verſes, both are verſe.</p>
            <p>But laying this aſide, tell mee what thou mindeſt to do in
this our buſineſſe? for though I underſtood not what the
<hi>Baſhaw's</hi> treated in the Tent, till thou haſt carried away
<hi>Leoniſa;</hi> a <hi>Renegado</hi> of my Maſter a <hi>Venetian</hi> told
me all, who was then preſent, and underſtood the Turkiſh language very
well. And therefore above all things it is moſt need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and requiſite to
ſet our wits a worke, and ſeeke out ſome plot to prevent
<hi>Leoniſa's</hi> comming to the hands of the <hi>Grand-Signior.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which is fitteſt firſt of all to bee done (anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Mahamut</hi>) is, that thou come to bee in the power of my Maſter. This
being effected, wee will afterwards conſult on that which ſhall convene
beſt for us. Whileſt they were thus talking, came the Guardian of the
Chriſtian Captives belonging to <hi>Hazan,</hi> and carried <hi>Ricardo</hi>
away with him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cadi</hi> returned with <hi>Hazan</hi> to the Citie, who
in a few dayes diſpatched <hi>Ali's</hi> Reſidencie, and gave it him roll'd
up and ſealed, that hee might carry it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him to
<hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Hee taking his leave, prepared forthwith to ſet
forward on his journey, being very inſtant with the <hi>Cadi,</hi> that hee
would ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten the ſending of the Captive, and withall write his Letters to
the <hi>Grand-Signior</hi> in his favour, for the better furthering of his
pretenſions: the <hi>Cadi</hi> promiſed him he would, but with trecherous
bowells which were almoſt turned into aſhes, ſo were they ſet on fire
by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed love which he bare to the Captive.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ali</hi> being gone full of falſe hopes, and <hi>Hazan</hi>
abiding behinde not voyd of them; <hi>Mahamut</hi> ſo brought the
buſineſſe about, that <hi>Ricardo</hi> came into the power of his
Maſter. Houres and dayes ran on, the time paſt away<pb n="147" facs="tcp:58406:77"/>and
the longing deſire to ſee <hi>Leoniſa;</hi> did ſo preſſe and wring
<hi>Ricardo,</hi> that hee could not take one poore ſhort mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute of
reſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ricardo</hi> changed his owne name into that of
<hi>Mario,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his might not come to <hi>Leoniſa's</hi> eares,
before that his eyes had ſeene her. And for to ſee her was very hard and
difficult; for that the <hi>Moores</hi> are extreamly jealous, and keep covered
from all men the faces of their women; howbeit they doe not much miſlike the
ſhewing of them to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, which happily may bee; becauſe being
Captives, they doe not reckon them for men, but ſlight them as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
creatures.</p>
            <p>Yet one day it ſo happened, that the Lady <hi>Halima</hi> ſaw
her ſlave <hi>Mario;</hi> and in ſeeing him tooke ſuch a good liking of
him, that hee remained deepely engraven in her heart, and ſtrongly fixed in
her memory. And peradventure ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king little contentment in the cold and weake
embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of her aged husband, ſhe the more eaſily gave way to this her
evill deſire. And with the like eaſineſſe ſhee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<hi>Leoniſa</hi> therewith, whom ſhe now dearely loved, and made exceeding
much of, for her ſweete behaviour, and diſcreet carriage; and likewiſe
ſhewed her great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, for that ſhee was to be ſent for a raritie
to the <hi>Grand-Signior,</hi> She acquainted her, how that the <hi>Cads</hi>
had brought and received into his houſe a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Captive, of
ſo gentle an aſpect, and comely preſence; that in her eye, he was the
handſomeſt man that ever ſhee ſaw in her life: and that they ſayd he
was a <hi>Chilibi,</hi> that is to ſay a Gentleman, and Countrey-man to
<hi>Mahamut,</hi> their <hi>Renegado;</hi> and that ſhee knew not how to give
him clearely to underſtand the good will and affection which ſhe bare unto
him; fearing leaſt that the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ſhould ſlight and
neglect her, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring and manifeſting her love unto him at the firſt
fight, before ſhe had further and better knowledge of him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leoniſa</hi> askt her what was the Captives name:
<hi>Hamila</hi> told her <hi>Mario:</hi> to whom <hi>Leoniſa</hi> replied; if
he be a Gentleman,<pb n="148" facs="tcp:58406:78"/>and of that place they ſay he is,
certainely I ſhould know him; but of this name <hi>(Mario,)</hi> I doe not
remember that there is any ſuch in <hi>Trapana.</hi> But if it ſhall
ſtand with your Ladiſhips pleaſure that I may but ſee him, and talke a
while with him, I ſhall be able to informe you both who he is, and what may
behoped from him; It ſhall be ſo ſayd <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lima,</hi> and on Friday
next, when as the <hi>Cadi</hi> ſhall bee at the <hi>Mezquita,</hi>
performing thoſe Rites and Ceremonies which are then and there required in
their devotions, and adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; I will take occaſion to call him in hither,
where leaving you two together, you may talke alone by your ſelves; and if
you thinke fit, you may give him ſome inck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of my deſires, and well
wiſhings towards him, and that you will doe me this friendly office in the
beſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner your wit and diſcretion can deviſe, of both which I have had
already ſufficient tryall, and therefore need not to expreſſe my ſelfe,
or preſſe you any farther in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Halima</hi> ſayd to <hi>Leoniſa,</hi> and within
leſſe then two houres afres, the <hi>Cadi</hi> called <hi>Mahamut,</hi> and
<hi>Mario</hi> unto him, and with no leſſe effecacie then <hi>Halima</hi>
had diſcovered her heart to <hi>Leoniſa,</hi> did this enamoured old young
man diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his to his two ſlaves, craving their councell and adviſe,
what courſe he ſhould take for to keepe the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> to
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and enjoy her; and yet oumply with the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>
whoſe ſhe was: telling them withall, that hee would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dye a
thouſand deaths, then deliver her up once to the great <hi>Turke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With ſuch affection did this <hi>Moore</hi> expreſſe his
paſſions, that they left a deepe impreſſion and beliefe in the hearts
of his two ſlaves; whoſe thoughts were fully bent to runne a contrary
courſe to that which he imagined. He thought one thing, and they another; in
the end, it was concluded betweene them, that <hi>Mario,</hi> as being a man of
her owne Nation and Countrey (howbeit he had told him that hee know her not)
ſhould take in hand the ſoliciting her, and<pb n="149" facs="tcp:58406:78"/>in
declaring his ſervent affection: And in caſe that by his faire meanes hee
could not prevaile and procure her good will, he ſhould then uſe force,
ſhe being now in his power: and this being done, to give out that ſhe was
dead, and ſo hee ſhould excuſe his ſending of her to
<hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Cadi</hi> reſted wonderfull well contented with this
deviſe of his ſlaves, and out of the great joy which he had imagined to
himſelfe, he inſtantly gave <hi>Mahamut</hi> his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; bequeathing
beſides unto him after his death, the one halfe of his goods. Hee likewiſe
promiſed <hi>Mario,</hi> if he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured that which hee ſo earneſtly
deſired, not onely his libertie, but good ſtore of Crownes, wherewith he
ſhould returne home to his owne Countrey, rich, honoured, and contented.</p>
            <p>If he were liberall in promiſing, his Captives were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall,
offering to hale downe the Moone from Heaven; to doe him ſervice, how much
more eaſily to draw <hi>Leoniſa</hi> to the bent of his Bow, and to
condiſcend to his deſire; ſo as <hi>Mario</hi> by his leave might have
the conveniencie offered him of ſpeaking with her. I will give him free leave
of acceſſe unto her, anſwered the <hi>Cadi,</hi> even as often as nee
will himſelfe, if that will advance the buſineſſe. For I will ſo
order it, that <hi>Halima</hi> ſhall goe hence to the houſe of her Parents,
who are <hi>Greeke-Chriſtians,</hi> where ſhee ſhall ſtay ſome few
daies, or longer time (if need be;) and ſhe being abroad, I will command my
Porter that he ſuffer <hi>Maris</hi> to enter into the houſe, and to have
free ingreſſe and egreſſe, as oft as he pleaſeth. And I will tell
<hi>Leoniſa,</hi> that ſhe may (if it pleaſe her) talke and converſe
with her Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
            <p>Thus did the winde begin to chop about of <hi>Ricardo's</hi>
misfortunes, blowing with a gentle gale in his favour, his Maſter not witting
which way hee meant to ſhape his courſe. This appointment being made and
concluded on between theſe three; the firſt that laid this plots was
<hi>Halima,</hi> ſhewing her ſelf a right woman, whoſe nature is facile,
and<pb n="150" facs="tcp:58406:79"/>whoſe wit quicke, and ſodaine, for the effecting of
that which ſhe hath a minde unto; eſpecially if her heart bee eagerly ſet

which <hi>Leoniſa</hi> had given her; ſhee not onely would not go to her

therefore told him, that a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhe went, ſhe would carry the Captive <hi>Chriſtian</hi>
along with her. O by no meane (replyed the <hi>Cadi,</hi>) for it is not fit;
that this Pledge of the <hi>Grand-Signior</hi> ſhould bee ſeene of any;
beſides, it would do her more hurt than good to converſe with
<hi>Chriſtians,</hi> ſince that you know, that when ſhe comes into the
power of the <hi>Grand-Signior,</hi> ſhe muſt be ſhut up in the
<hi>Seraglio,</hi> and turne <hi>Turke</hi> whether ſhe will or no. But if

The <hi>Cali</hi> made no reply, that hee might not give her oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to
breed ſome ſuſpition or other in her, of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
            <p>Whileſt this bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſineſſe was a brewing, Friday came, and helwent to the
<hi>Mezquita,</hi> from whence he could not come forth in almoſt foure
houres; and <hi>Halima</hi> had ſcarce ſeene him put his foot over the
threſhold of his houſe, but ſhee commandeil <hi>Mario</hi> to be call'd
for to come unto her; but a<pb n="151" facs="tcp:58406:79"/>
               <hi>Chriſtian</hi> of
<hi>Corſica</hi> would not ſuffer him to enter, who was then Porter and
wayted at the gate of the outward Court; if <hi>Halima</hi> her ſelfe had not
called out aloud unto him that hee ſhould let him come in. And ſo hee
entred, but much troubled, and trembling, as if hee had beene to fight with a
whole armie of enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leoniſa</hi> was in the ſame dreſſe and attyre as when
ſhee entred the <hi>Baſhaw's</hi> Tent, ſitting at the foot of a curious
ſtayr-caſe of poliſhed Marble, which led the way up to a large and
ſpacious gallerie rounding the whole houſe; her head hung downeward towards
her boſome, reſting it ſelfe on the palme of her right hand, and leaning
her el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow on her knee, her eyes were turned another way quite contrarie to the
doore by which <hi>Mario</hi> entred; ſo that though hee went towards the
place where ſhee ſate, yet did ſhe not ſee him.</p>
            <p>No ſooner was <hi>Ricardo</hi> let in, but hee walked through
the whole houſe with his eyes, yet could he not perceive any thing ſave a
dumbe and ſtill filence, till that hee caſt his eye aſide where
<hi>Leoniſa</hi> fate: Inſtantly whereupon, ſo many thoughts tooke hold
on enamoured <hi>Ricardo,</hi> as did worke in him both amazement and
gladneſſe, concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelfe to bee a thouſand paces and more
diſtanced from his happineſſe and contentment. Hee conſidered
likewiſe with himſelfe that hee was a Captive, and his glorie in anothers
power revolving theſe things with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, he made towards her by a
little and a little, and with a fearefull love, a joyfull ſadneſſe, and
timerous courage, (for ſuch paſſions accompanie true lovers) hee came by
degrees to the Center where his hearts joy was, when by chance
<hi>Leoniſa</hi> turned her head aſide, and fixed her eyes on thoſe of
<hi>Mario,</hi> who looked very ſtedfaſtly on her.</p>
            <p>But when both their lookes had thus encountred each other by
different effects, gave evident ſignes of that which their ſeverall
ſoules felt within. <hi>Ricardo</hi> ſtood ſtock ſtill and could not
ſtirre one foot further, and <hi>Leoniſa,</hi>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:58406:80"/>who upon
<hi>Mahamuts</hi> relation gave <hi>Ricardo</hi> for dead, and to ſee him now
and that ſo unexpectedly alive, full of feare, and amazement, without
unfixing her eyes, or turning her backe, ſhee ſtept up backeward foure or
five ſtayres, ſhe bleſt her ſelfe as if ſhee had ſeene ſome
phantaſma, or a thing of another World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ricardo</hi> returned from out his aſtoniſhment, and knew
by that which <hi>Leoniſa</hi> did, the ture cauſe of her feare, and
therefore ſayd unto her; it grieves mee to the very ſoule, (oh of all
fayre, the fayreſt <hi>Leoniſa</hi>) that the newes did not fall out true
which <hi>Mahamut</hi> gave thee of my death, for by it I might have excuſed
thoſe feares which now I have, in thinking with my ſelfe whether that
rigour which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore thou haſt uſed towards me, continue ſtill in the
ſame force and being? Quiet your ſelfe (deareſt in my love) and come
downe againe, and if you dare do that which hitherto you never did, which is;
to draw neare unto me, come and touch me, and thou ſhalt ſee that I am no
phantaſticall bodie, no wandring ghoſt; I am <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardo (Leoniſa)</hi>
that unfortunate <hi>Ricardo</hi> whom thou haſt made ſo.</p>
            <p>Whileſt he was ſpeaking this, <hi>Leoniſa</hi> puts her
finger u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon her mouth, whereby <hi>Ricardo</hi> underſtood that it was a
ſigne that hee ſhould be ſilent, or ſpeake more ſoftly: and taking a
little better heart unto him, he drew a little nearer unto her in ſuch a
diſtance, that he might heare theſe words come from her. Speake lower
<hi>(Mario)</hi> for ſo me thinketh thou now calleſt thy ſelfe, and
treate not of any other thing now, ſave what I ſhall treate with thee, and
conſider withall that it may ſo happen that if we be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard, we
ſhall never ſee one another any more: I verily beleeve that <hi>Halima</hi>
our Miſtreſſe liſteneth to heare, if not heareth us; who (to deale
plainely and briefly with thee) hath told me that ſhe adores thee, and hath
entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me to be the interceſſoreſſe of this her deſire: if thou
wilt anſwer her wiſhes, it will bee better for thy bodie 
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:58406:80"/>then thy ſoule. But if thou wilt not, yet muſt thou
feigne that thou doſt embrace her love; as well becauſe ent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eate thee ſo to do, as alſo for
that the declared deſires of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ought not uncivily to be deſpiſed
and utterly rejected.</p>
            <p>Hereunto <hi>Ricardo</hi> anſwered, I did never thinke nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
could imagine (fayreſt <hi>Leoniſa</hi>) that there was that thing
whatſoever which you ſhould entreate me to doe, that ſhould bring with it
an impoſſibilitie of cumply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therewith: but that which you now require
of mee, hath diſ-deceived me: Is peradventure mans will ſo light, that it
may be moved too and fro, and carried hither and thither, whether the
pleaſure of others ſhall guide and direct it? or doth it ſtand with the
honour and faith of a Gentleman, or with the repute of an honeſt man, to
feigne and diſſemble in things of ſuch weight and high a nature as this
is? If it ſeeme good unto you, that any of theſe things in this kinde ought
to bee or may be done; doe that which ſhall be moſt pleaſing in your owne
eyes, becauſe you are the ſole Miſtreſſe of my will. But I now know
that you likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me in this, ſince that you never rightly knew my
will, and therefore know not how to diſpoſe thereof; but becauſe you may
not ſay that in the firſt thing you commanded me, you ſhould not bee
obeyed; I will loſe ſomewhat of my ſelfe, and of being what I ought to
be, I will ſatisfie your deſire, and that of <hi>Halima</hi> (as you ſay)
feignedly, ſo that I may thereby gaine the happines to ſee you. And
therefore doe you feigne my anſwers to your owne good liking, for from hence
forth my feigned will doth firme, and confirme them. Now in requitall of this
office which I do for you, which is in my opinion the greateſt that ever I
can or ſhall be able to doe, though I ſhould give my ſoule anew unto you,
which I have ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten given you; I beſeech you, that you will briefly tell
me, how you eſcaped from the hands of the Pirats, and how you came to thoſe

<hi>Leoniſa</hi>) require more leiſure then time will now permit to relate,
yet notwithſtanding I will not leave you wholy unſatisfied. Know then, that
the ſame very evening we parted, <hi>Yzupb's</hi> Galley was with a ſtiffe
and ſtrong winde driven to the ſame Iſles of <hi>Pantanalea,</hi> where
wee likewiſe ſaw your Veſſell; but ours, wee being not able to hinder

               </gap>e remedileſly upon the
Rockes. My Maſter then having his deſtruction before his eyes, and that
there was little or no hope of ſafety left; with all poſſible haſte
emptied two Hogſheads which were full of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then ſtopped up the
bung-holes very cloſe, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving bound the one to the other with good
ſtrong cords, he ſeated me betweene them; that done hee preſently
ſtript himſelfe, and taking another Hogſhead, ſpreading his armes over
it, and binding a rope about his middle, cauſing the ſame to bee faſtned
to the Caskes whereon I ſate bound, with great courage hee ruſhed into the
Sea, towing mee after him. I had not the heart to ruſh in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, which
one of the Turkes ſeeing, puſhed mee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with all his force, and
ſent mee packing after <hi>Yzuph,</hi> where I lay without any ſenſe, nor
came againe to my ſelfe, tall I found my ſelfe on Land in the armes of two
Turkes; who bowing my head and bodie towards the ground, held me ſo a pretry
ſpace, all that while great ſtore of ſalt-water which I had ſwallowed
downe, comming forth at my mouth.</p>
            <p>At laſt I opened mine eyes, but as one amazed, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about, who ſhould I ſee, but <hi>Yzuph</hi> lying by me with his braines
beaten out againſt the Rockes when hee had almoſt recovered the ſhoare,
where hee ended his life. This I afterwards underſtood by the Turkes; and
they likewiſe told mee, that taking hold of the Cord, they drew mee on Land,
without receiving any further harme then what I mentioned before unto you, of
all the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, onely eight perſons aſcaped drowning. Fight daies 
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:58406:81"/>wee abode in the Iſland, the Turkes uſing mee with as
much reſpect as if I had beene their Siſter, if not more. Wee kept our
ſelves cloſe in a Cave, the Turkes fearing that if they ſhould bee
eſpied, the Chriſtians which had the command of the Fort which is in the
Iſland, would ſalley forth upon them and take them Captive. They
ſuſtained themſelves with wet bisket which the Sea had caſt upon the
ſhoare from out the broken bins of the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, which they went forth to
gather up by night that they might not be diſcovered.</p>
            <p>Fortune had ſo ordered it for my great ill, that the Fort was
without a Captaine, who died but a few daies before; and in all the Fort there
were not above twenty ſouldiers. This we came to know by a youth which was
captivated by the Turkes, who came downe from thence to gather Cockles by the
Sea-ſide. At the eight daies end, there arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on that Coaſt a
Veſſell of the <hi>Moores,</hi> which they call <hi>Caramucales;</hi> the
Turkes ſaw it's comming in, and that they lay at Anchor a little off the Land
and ſo made towards them, making ſuch ſignes to the Veſſell which was
not far off, that they who were in her knew they were Turkes that called unto
them. Thereupon they ſent out their Cock-boat, and they recounted unto them
their diſtreſſe, and they received them into their Barque wherein came an
exceeding rich Iew, a Merchant; and all the lading of the Veſſell, or the
moſt part of it was his, being fraughted with Carpets, and Hides, and other
commodities which they bring from <hi>Barbary,</hi> to the <hi>Levant.</hi> In
the ſaid Veſſell the Turkes went for <hi>Tripoli,</hi> and in that Voyage
they ſold me to the <hi>Iew</hi> for two thouſand Duckats, an exceſſive
priſe, if his love towards me had not made him ſo liberall, which the
<hi>Iew</hi> afterwards diſcovered unto me.</p>
            <p>Leaving the Turkes after all this in <hi>Tripoli,</hi> the
Veſſell tackt about to performe her Voyage, and the <hi>Iew</hi> in moſt

himſelfe then in deſpaire of obtaining his luſtfull ends, he reſolved
to rid himſelfe of me upon the firſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion that ſhould offer it

hither with intention to ſell me to one of the two <hi>Baſhaw's;</hi> and
for this cauſe put mee into this dreſſe and weare wherein you now ſee
me, for to affectionate them the more unto me who ſhould buy me.</p>
            <p>I am given to underſtand that this <hi>Cadi</hi> hath bought me,
with purpoſe to carry me for a Preſent to the <hi>Great-Turke,</hi> whereof
I am not a little afraid. Here I came to know thy feigned death; and I muſt
now tell thee if thou wilt believe me, and believe me thou maiſt, that it
grieved me to the very ſoule, and that I did more envie then pittie thee; yet
not out of any ill will that I bare unto thee, though I did not anſwer thy

meanes of working an impoſſibilitie (for you know my minde touching the
motion you made unto mee) and me to be likewiſe ſet a worke about ſuch a
buſineſſe as I leaſt dream't of, and for which I would give, rather
then obtaine it, my life which now I eſteeme according to it's high worth and
valew, ſince that it hath had the happineſſe to ſee you.</p>
            <p>I know not what to ſay unto thee <hi>Ricardo,</hi> replied
<hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſa,</hi> nor how we ſhall be able to get out of this intricate
laborinth, whereinto (as thou ſayeſt) our hard fortune hath brought us;
onely I know to ſay thus much, that we muſt be driven in this
buſineſſe to uſe that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our condition, and hatefull
to honeſt mindes; to wit, diſſembling, and deceit. And therefore ſay
unto thee, that I will acquaint <hi>Halima</hi> with ſome ſuch words
delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by thee, that ſhall rather entertaine her with hopes, then drive
her to diſpaire. Thou likewiſe ſhalt ſay of me to the <hi>Cadi</hi>
that which thou ſhalt thinke moſt convenient for the ſecuring of mine
honour, and the deceiving of him. And ſince that I put mine honour into thy
hands, thou maiſt aſſure thy ſelfe that it is yet as true and entire as
ever; though the many wayes which I have gone, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny aſſaults which
I have endured might call it into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, though you nor any elſe
without great injuſtice, can make the leaſt doubt of it. For our ſpeaking
and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing each with other, will be (by their meanes) moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile and
eaſie: alwayes preſuppoſed, that you never once open your mouth, nor
treate ought with me, which ſhall any way appertaine to your declared
pretenſion; for in what houre you ſhall doe that, in the ſame you ſhall
take your leave of ſeeing mee any more. For I would not have thee thinke that
my valew is of ſo little worth, and of ſo few quilates, that Captivity
ſhall worke that with me, which liberty could not do. I will be (by heavens
fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour) like gold, which the longer it is in the Chryfoll, comes forth thence
the purer, and the finer: reſt ſatisfied<pb n="158" facs="tcp:58406:83"/>and content
thy ſelfe with that which I have alreadie ſaid unto thee, leaſt the very
ſight of thee ſhould (as it hath done heretofore) cauſe a diſtance in
me, if not a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. For I would have thee to know <hi>(Ricardo)</hi> that I
alwaies held thee to be too rough and arrogant, and to preſume ſomewhat
more of thy ſelfe then was fitting. I confeſſe likewiſe that I may be
deceived; and it may be that making this tryall of thee, experience will ſet
the truth before mine eyes, and tell mee I was deceived; and being put out of
this errour, I may bee more kinde, but never leſſe honeſt: goe get you
gone, for I feare me <hi>Halima</hi> may have over-heard us, who hath ſome
under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of our Chriſtian language; at leaſt of that ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
ſpeech which is uſed, whereby wee all underſtand one another.</p>
            <p>You ſay very well (Miſtris of my heart) anſwered
<hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardo,</hi> and I infinitely thanke you, and take in exceeding good part
this diſ-deceiving which you have given mee; and make as high eſteeme
thereof, as of the favour you doe mee in ſuffering me to ſee you. And as
you ſay ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience peradventure will make knowne unto you how plaine and
downe-right my condition is, and how meek and humble my diſpoſition,
eſpecially for to adore you; and had you not put a bound and limit to my
carriage and treating with you, yet ſhould it have beene ſo fayre and ſo
honeſt towards you, as you cannot wiſh or deſire to have it better.</p>
            <p>Touching that which concerneth the entertaining-of the
<hi>Cadi,</hi> take you no care of that, leave it to me, doe you the like with
<hi>Halima.</hi> And by the way, I would have you (Lady) to know, that ſince
I have ſeene you, there is bred in me ſuch a ſtrong hope and confidence;
as aſſureth mee that it ſhall not bee long before wee procure our
deſired libertie, and ſo God have you in his keeping, at another time, and
better leifure, I ſhall relate unto you the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the turnings and
windings by which fortune hath<pb n="159" facs="tcp:58406:83"/>brought me to this eſtate,
after that ſhe had put us a ſunder and ſever'd me from your ſight: with
this they tooke their leaves each of other, <hi>Leoniſa</hi> remaining well
contented and ſatisfied with <hi>Ricardo's</hi> plaine proceeding, and he the
moſt joyfull man in the world, that he had heard one word from
<hi>Leoniſa's</hi> mouth without tartneſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Halima</hi> had ſhut up her ſelfe in her oratorie, praying
to her prophet <hi>Mahomet,</hi> that <hi>Leoniſa</hi> might bring her a good
diſpatch of that buſineſſe which ſhe had recommended unto her. The
<hi>Cadi,</hi> he was in the <hi>Mezquita,</hi> recompenſing with his
deſires thoſe of his wife, they keeping him very ſolicitous, as wholy
depending on the anſwer which hee hoped to heare from his Slave, to whoſe
charge hee had committed his talking with <hi>Leoniſa;</hi> and that bee
might better come to have ſome ſpeech with her, <hi>Mahamut</hi> ſhould
afford him opportunitie, though that <hi>Halima</hi> were in the houſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leoniſa</hi> encreaſed in <hi>Halima</hi> her lewd luſt
and filthie deſire, by giving her very good hopes that <hi>Mario</hi> would
condiſcend to her will, and doe whatſoever ſhee would command him. But
telling her withall, that ſhee muſt have patience till two Moones were
firſt paſt over; before which time hee could not cumply with that which hee
much more deſired then her ſelfe. And this terme hee entreated of her, that
hee might make his prayers and ſupplications unto God, for the freeing of him
from his Captivitie, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring him againe to his former libertie.
<hi>Halima</hi> conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her ſelfe with the excuſe and relation of her
belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Ricardo,</hi> whom ſhe would free from his ſlaverie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the deputed time, ſo as hee would accompliſh her deſire. And therefore
entreated <hi>Leoniſa,</hi> that ſhee would treate with him, and ſee if
ſhee could worke him to diſpence with the ſayd time, and to cut off all

               </gap>s; and ſhe would furniſh
him with as much money as the <hi>Cadi</hi> ſhould require of him for his
ranſome.</p>

was deſperate, no hope of winning her, and that as ſoone as poſſibly he
could, he ſhould carry her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> and that in
the way thitherward, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by faire meanes, or by force obtaine his deſire.
And as touching the inconvenience which might offer it ſelfe for his
cumplying with the <hi>Grand-Signior,</hi> hee ſhould doe well to buy him
another Slave; and in the voyage to feign and cauſe it to be given our that
<hi>Leoniſa</hi> was fallen ſicke, and making our advantage of a darke
night, we may caſt the bought Chriſtian over-boord into the Sea, ſaying;
that it was <hi>Leoniſa,</hi> the Captive of the <hi>Grand-Signior</hi> that
was dead: and that may be done, and ſhould be done in ſuch manner that the
truth thereof ſhould never be diſcovered, and ſo remaine blameleſſe
with the <hi>Grand-Signior,</hi> and fulfill his owne will; and that for the
continuation of his pleaſure, they would afterwards deviſe ſome
convenient courſe, that ſhould make all ſafe and ſure.</p>
            <p>This poore man, this old <hi>Cadi,</hi> his love to
<hi>Leoniſa</hi> made him ſo blinde, that had they told him a thouſand
other greater unlikelihoods (ſo as they were directed to the fulfilling of
his hopes) he would have believed them all; how much more when it ſeemed unto
him, that all which they ſaid, was good and currant, and in a very faire way,
promiſing proſperous ſucceſſe. And ſo indeed it might have proved,
if the intention of theſe his two counſellors had not beene to make
themſelves Maſters of the Veſſell, and to make an end of him, and his
fooliſh thoughts together.</p>
            <p>But another difficultie offered it ſelfe to the <hi>Cadi,</hi>
which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> his owne opinion was
greater then all the reſt; it run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſtill in his head that his wife
<hi>Halima</hi> would not let him goe to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> unleſſe
he would carry her with him. But preſently they did facilitate that, telling
him,<pb n="161" facs="tcp:58406:84"/>that in ſtead of the Chriſtian which they were to
buy, and muſt dye and be turn'd over-boor'd inſtead of <hi>Leoniſa,
Hali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> would ſerve excellently for that purpoſe, and none bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of
whom he deſired to be freed more then from death. With the ſame facilitie
as he entertained this in his thought, with the like, did <hi>Mahamut,</hi> and
<hi>Ricardo,</hi> yeeld there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p>And being firmely reſolved thereon, that very day the
<hi>Cadi</hi> breakes with <hi>Halima</hi> about the voyage which hee thought
to make to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to carrie the Chriſtian to the
<hi>Grand-Signior;</hi> by whoſe liberalitie, hee hoped hee ſhould bee made
the great <hi>Cadi</hi> of <hi>Cayro,</hi> or of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.
Halima</hi> told him that ſhee liked very well of his determination, thinking
that hee would leave <hi>Ricardo</hi> at home. But when the <hi>Cadi</hi> had
certified her that hee would carrie him along with him, and likewiſe
<hi>Mahamut;</hi> ſhee beganne to change her opinion, and to diſ-adviſe
him from that, which before ſhee had advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to doe. In fine, ſhe
concluded, that if he did not take her with him, ſhe would in no hand give
way to his going. The <hi>Cadi</hi> would not croſſe her, but if ſhe
would needes have it ſo, her will ſhould be his; thinking then with
himſelfe that he would quickly ſhake off that yoake, which lay ſo heavie
on his necke.</p>
            <p>All this while <hi>Hazon Baſhaw</hi> was not careleſſe in
ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Cadi</hi> to deliver up the Slave unto him, offering him
mountaines of gold, having beſides given him <hi>Ricardo</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for
nothing, whoſe ranſome he prized at two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crownes. All theſe
gifts and promiſes wrought no further good with the <hi>Cadi,</hi> then to
make him haſten the more his departure: and ſo ſolicited by his deſire,
and by the importunities of <hi>Haz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n,</hi> together with thoſe of <hi>Halima,</hi> who likewiſe
built vaine hopes in the Ayre.</p>
            <p>Within twenty dayes he had fitted and rigged up a
<hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantine</hi> of fifteene bankes, manning it with voluntary Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
luſty young able men, partly <hi>Moores,</hi> partly <hi>Greeke</hi> 
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:58406:85"/>Chriſtians. Therein he embarqued all his wealth, and
<hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lima</hi> left not ought at hoine in her houſe of any moment, and
entreated her husband that he would give her leave to carry with her, her
Father and Mother, that they might ſee <hi>Conſtantinople. Halima's</hi>
intention was the ſame with that of <hi>Mahamut;</hi> meaning to deale with
him and <hi>Ricardo,</hi> that when they were on their voyage, they ſhould
make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of the <hi>Bregantine,</hi> and goe away with it.
But ſhe would not open her minde, nor declare her ſelfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, till
ſhe ſaw her ſelf embarqued; and this too with with a full purpoſe and
reſolution to goe to the Chriſtians Countrey, and to returne to that
Religion which ſhe had firſt beene of, and to bee married to
<hi>Ricardo;</hi> being verily perſwaded, that carrying ſuch ſtore of
wealth along with her, and turning Chriſtian, he would not refuſe to take
her to wife.</p>
            <p>In this interim, <hi>Ricardo</hi> had ſpeech with
<hi>Leoniſa,</hi> and declared unto her his whole intention; and ſhee
againe acquainted him with <hi>Halima's</hi> purpoſe, who had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted the
ſame unto her They injoyned each other ſecreſie, and recommending
themſelves to God, they ſtood expecting the day of their departure. Which
being come, <hi>Hazan</hi> went forth, accompanying them with all his Souldiers
to the Sea-ſide; and did not leave them, till they had hoyſed ſayle;
neither did he take off his eye from the <hi>Bregantine,</hi> till hee had
quite loſt the ſight of it. And it ſeemed that the Ayre, and breath of
thoſe ſighes which the enamoured <hi>Moere</hi> vented forth, did fill and
drive forward with greater force the ſayles, which waſted away his
ſoule.</p>
            <p>But he, as one who a long time liv'd in ſuch torment,
oppreſſed by love that hee could take no reſt, thinking on that which hee
was to doe, that hee might not dye by the bands of his violent deſires,
omitted not to put that preſently in execution, which with long delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and a reſolute determination, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e
had forecaſted.<pb n="163" facs="tcp:58406:85"/>And therefore in a Veſſell of
ſeventeene bankes which he had made readie in another Port, he clapt into her
fifty Souldiers, all his friends and acquaintance, whom he had obliged unto him
by many gifts and promiſes; giving them in charge, that they ſhould put
forth to Sea, ſet u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, and take the <hi>Cadi's Bregantine,</hi> and all the
wealth that was in her; putting to the edge of the ſword as many as went in
her, ſave <hi>Leoniſa</hi> the Captive, for ſhe was the onely ſpoyle
that he look't after, prizing her above all the other riches and treaſure
which were in the Veſſell. He likewiſe gave order that they ſhould
ſincke her, ſo that not any one thing might remaine, that might give any
the leaſt ſigne or token of their perdition.</p>
            <p>The covetouſneſſe of the ſpoyle added wings to their feet,
and courage to their hearts; howbeit they knew very well that they ſhould
find but little reſiſtance in thoſe of the <hi>Bregantine,</hi> in regard
that they were diſarmed, and without any the leaſt ſuſpition that any
ſuch unexpected accident ſhould befall them. Two dayes had the
<hi>Bregan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> now gone in her intended courſe, which to the
<hi>Cadi</hi> ſeemed two Ages; for the very firſt day of all, he would
feigne have put in execution his determination: But his Slaves adviſed him,
that the buſineſſe muſt firſt be ſo carried that <hi>Leoniſa</hi>
ſhould fall ſicke, to give thereby ſome colour to her death, and that
this would require ſome daies of ſickneſſe. He did not like of that,
but would have it given out that ſhe died ſuddainly, and ſo quickely make
an end of what they had projected, by diſpatching his Wife out of hand, that
he might allay the heate of that fire, which by little and little went
conſuming his bowels. But in concluſion he muſt condiſcend to that,
which the other two thought fit.</p>
            <p>Now in this meane while, <hi>Halima</hi> had declared her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to <hi>Mahamut,</hi> and <hi>Ricardo,</hi> and they were readie to put it in
execution, as ſoone as they had doubled the points of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> or
paſſed by the Caſtles of <hi>Natolia.</hi> But the <hi>Cadi</hi> 
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:58406:86"/>was ſo haſty with them, and ſo ſharpe ſet, that
they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to performe the taske they undertooke, upon the firſt
occaſion that ſhould offer it ſelfe unto them. And one day at the end of
ſixe, which they had ſailed another Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and that now it ſeemed to
the <hi>Cadi,</hi> that the feigning of <hi>Leoniſa's</hi> ſickneſſe
was ſufficient, he did importune his Slaves that they ſhould conclude the
next day with <hi>Halima,</hi> and throw her (wrapt up in a winding ſheet)
into the ſea, ſaying; it was the Captive of the <hi>Grana-Signior.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The day afterwards beganne to breake, wherein (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the
intention of <hi>Mahamut,</hi> and <hi>Ricardo</hi>) was to be the
accompliſhment of their deſires, or the end of their dayes; when loe, they
might deſcry a Veſſell, which with ſayle and oare came chaſing them.
They were afraid that they were Chriſtian Pirats, from whom neither the one
nor the other could expect any good. For being ſuch, the <hi>Moores</hi>
feared to bee made Captives; and the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that though they ſhould
get their libertie, they ſhould loſe their goods, and be ſtript of all
they had. But <hi>Mahamut</hi> and <hi>Ricardo</hi> contented themſelves with
<hi>Leoniſa's,</hi> and their owne libertie; yet notwithſtanding this
imagined hope, they much feared the inſolencie of your Rovers at Sea, for
they that follow ſuch kinde of exerciſes, and make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon trade thereof,
bee they of what Religion or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo ever, they uſually are cruelly
minded, and of an inſolent condition.</p>
            <p>They prepared to defend themſelves, without forſaking their
oares, and doing all that might bee done in ſuch a caſe of neceſſity,
and ſo ſuddaine. It was not long, a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of two or three houres, little
more or leſſe, that they drew neerer and neerer, till they came within
Canon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot of them. Seing this, they ſtrooke ſayle, looſed their Oares,
betooke themſelves to their Armes, and expected their comming.</p>
            <p>Howbeit, the <hi>Cadi</hi> bid them be of good cheere, and fear
nothing, for the Veſſell was <hi>Turkiſh,</hi> and would not doe 
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:58406:86"/>them any harme. He commanded that a white flagge in token
of peace ſhould preſently be ſet up, placing it on the yard ſayle of
the Poope, becauſe they might the better diſcerne it, who being already
blinded with covetouſneſſe and greedineſſe of gaine, made up with
great furie to boord the ill defended <hi>Bregantine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whileſt this was in acting, <hi>Mahamut</hi> by chance turned
his head aſide, and perceived that from the Weſt-ward there was a Galley
comming up, and to his thinking of ſome twenty bankes, whereof he certified
the <hi>Cadi;</hi> and ſome Chriſtians which wrought at the Oare, ſayd,
that the Veſſell they had deſcried, was of Chriſtians. All which did
but double their confuſion and feare, holding them in ſuſpence, not
knowing what to doe; fearing and hoping ſuch ſucceſſe, as God ſhould
be pleaſed to give them.</p>
            <p>By this time I conceive that the <hi>Cadi</hi> would have given
(being in that ſtraight that now hee was) to have found himſelfe againe in
<hi>Nicoſia,</hi> all the hopes of his pleaſure, ſo great was the
confuſion and amazement wherein he was, tho he were quickly put out of it by
that firſt Veſſell, which without reſpect to the Flagge of peace, or
that which was due to their religion, did ſet upon that of the <hi>Cadi</hi>
with ſuch force and fury, that they wanted very little of ſinking it. The
<hi>Cadi</hi> preſently knew thoſe that had thus ſet upon them, for his
eyes gave him aſſured notice that the Souldiers were of <hi>Nicoſia.</hi>
He ſoone gueſſed the cauſe of their comming, and by whom ſet a worke,
and gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for a loſt and dead man: and had it not beene that the
Souldiers gave themſelves more to the ſpoyle, then the ſlaughter, not a
man of them had eſcaped alive.</p>
            <p>But when they were moſt buſie about their pillaging; a
<hi>Turke</hi> cry'de out aloud unto them ſaying, Arme, arme (fellow
Souldiers) for a Veſſell of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> is comming u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon us. And
he had good reaſon to ſay ſo, becauſe the Veſſell which <hi>Cadi's
Bregantine</hi> deſcried, bare <hi>Chriſtian</hi> flags, and very fiercely
did ſet upon that of <hi>Hazan;</hi> but before<pb n="166" facs="tcp:58406:87"/>they came
to grapple with her, one from the Prowe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of them in the
<hi>Turkiſh</hi> language what veſſell that was, and whence? They made
anſwer, that it was <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans</hi> the <hi>Baſhaw, Viceroy</hi> of
<hi>Cyprus.</hi> Why then (replied the <hi>Turke</hi>) you being
<hi>Muſoliman's</hi> have ſet upon and robbed this veſſell wherein wee
know goes the <hi>Cadi</hi> of <hi>Nicoſia?</hi> Whereunto they anſwered,
that they knew no other cauſe, ſave that they were commanded to take her;
and that they as being his Souldiers, in obedience unto him had done his
command.</p>
            <p>The Captaine of the ſecond veſſell who came in a
Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian diſguiſe; reſting ſatisfied with that which he deſired
to know, fell off from that of <hi>Hazan,</hi> and made towards that of the
<hi>Cadi;</hi> and with the very firſt volly of ſhot he gave them, he
killed ten of thoſe <hi>Turkes</hi> that were in her; and preſently after
entered her with great courage and ſpeed. But they had ſcarce ſet their
feet on the hatches, but <hi>Cadi</hi> inſtantly knew that it was not a
Chriſtian that had thus ſet upon him; but <hi>Ali Baſhaw</hi> who was in
love with <hi>Lconiſa,</hi> who with the ſame intent as <hi>Hazan,</hi>
ſtood wayting his comming; and that hee might not be knowne, had clad his
Souldiers like Chriſtians, to the end that by this deviſe, his theft might
not be diſcovered.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cadi,</hi> who knew the intentions of theſe Lovers, and
traytours, beganne in a loud voyce to vent his malice, ſaying; what is this
thou doeſt, (thou Traytour <hi>Ali Baſhaw</hi>) that thou being a
<hi>Muſolimam,</hi> that is to ſay, a <hi>Turke,</hi> ſetteſt upon mee
as a Chriſtian? And you Traytours, <hi>Hazans</hi> Souldiers, what a Devill
hath moved you to commit ſo great an outrage? for that to fulfill the
laſcivious and luſtfull appetite of him who ſent you hither, will thus go
againſt your naturall Lord.</p>
            <p>Vpon theſe words of his, all of them ſilenced their Armes, no
more clattering was heard; and looking one one upon another, they came at
laſt to know each other, becauſe they had all of them beene Souldiers of
one and<pb n="167" facs="tcp:58406:87"/>the ſame Captaine, and ſerved under one and the
ſame banner. And being now abaſhed at the <hi>Cadi's</hi> word, ond
aſhamed of their owne bad act; the points of their <hi>Cimiters</hi> were
blunted, and the edges of them dulled, their coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges were quelled, and their
mindes mightily diſmayed. Onely <hi>Ali</hi> ſhut his eyes, and eares, to
all that hee ſaw, or heard; and falling upon the <hi>Cadi,</hi> he gave him
ſuch a cut in the head, that if the blow had not beene borne off by a hundred
yards of <hi>Calico</hi> wrapt about it, doubtleſſe hee had cleft his head

and being fallen, the <hi>Cadi</hi> ſayd: O cruell <hi>Renegado,</hi> enemie
of our Prophet, and is it poſſible, that there is none that will chaſtice
thy cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and this thy great inſolencie? How, (accurſed as thou art)
durſt thou preſume to lay hands and draw thy ſword againſt thy
<hi>Cadi,</hi> and a miniſter of <hi>Mahomet?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe words added force, to force, and more fuell to the former
fire; the which being heard by <hi>Hazans</hi> Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and moved with feare
that <hi>Ali</hi> his Souldiers would take their prey from them (which they
held yet to bee theirs) they determined to put all upon adventure; and one
beginning firſt, and all the reſt following after, they ſet upon the
Souldiers of <hi>Ali</hi> with ſuch haſte, rancour, and courage; that in a
little while they behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo manfully, that though they were
more by many then they, they reduced them to a very ſmall number; but they
which remained of them, tooke heart unto them, leaving ſcarſe foure of
<hi>Hazans</hi> men alive, and thoſe very ſorely wounded.</p>

ever and anon put their heads out of the ſcupper-holes of the Poope Cabbin,
to ſee what would become of this great fray, which on both ſides was ſo
hotly purſued. And ſeeing that the <hi>Turkes</hi> were in a manner all
ſlaine, and they that were alive, ſore wounded, and how eaſily they might
make an end of all of them, he called to <hi>Mahamut,</hi> and

<hi>Greek</hi> Chriſtians, with a great deale of eaſe, and without
receiving any one wound, they cut the throats of them all; and boording
<hi>Ali's</hi> Galley, which they found without defence, they took it, with all
that was therein. Of thoſe that dyed in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond encounter, one of the

conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted what was now beſt to be done, in the end they yeelded to
<hi>Ricardo's</hi> advice, which was, that they ſhould take out all things
that were of any price or valew, both in their owne, and <hi>Hazans</hi>
veſſell, and ſtow them in <hi>Ali's</hi> Galley, which was a veſſell
of farre greater burthen, and fitter to take in the lading, and make good their

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:58406:88"/>would permit; they likewiſe told him that hee ſhould
make choice of one of theſe two, either to go with them to the Land of
Chriſtians, or to returne in the ſame Veſſell he ſet forth to
<hi>Nicoſia.</hi> Whereunto he anſwered, that ſince his ill fortune had
brought him to ſuch bad tearmes, hee would rather accept of the libertie
which they gave him, and that he would goe to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and
make his complaint to the <hi>Grand-Signior,</hi> of the great and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
wrong which from <hi>Hazan,</hi> and <hi>Ali</hi> he had received. But when he
knew that <hi>Halima</hi> would leave him and turne Chriſtian, he was
almoſt ready to run mad.</p>
            <p>In concluſion, they man'd his owne Veſſell, and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
him with all things neceſſarie for his voyage, and gave him ſome
<hi>Chequines,</hi> of thoſe which once had beene his owne. And ſo having
taken his leave of all of them, being reſolved to returne to
<hi>Nicoſia,</hi> he beſought before he had hoyſed ſayle, that
<hi>Leoniſa</hi> would doe him the favour to embrace him; for that grace and
honour ſhee therein ſhould ſhew him, would of it ſelfe bee ſufficient
to make him forget all his misfortune. All of them entreated
<hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſa</hi> to conferre that favour on one that lov'd her ſo well,
ſince in ſo doing, ſhee ſhould not goe againſt the <hi>decorum</hi>
and decencie of her honeſtie. <hi>Leoniſa</hi> yeelded to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
and the <hi>Cadi</hi> further entreated of her, that ſhee would but lay her
hands upon his head, for that he hoped that impoſition would heale his wound.
<hi>Leoniſa</hi> to give him content, condiſcended thereunto. This done,
and having bored many holes in <hi>Hazans</hi> Veſſell, a freſh Eaſt
winde favouring them, which ſeemed to court the ſayles, and wooe them, that
they might be admitted to come into them, did ſet them going amaine; ſo
that in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie few houres they loſt the ſight of the <hi>Cadi's
Bregantine,</hi> who with tears in his eyes, ſtood looking how the windes
carried away his wealth, his Wife, and with <hi>Leoniſa,</hi> his ſoules
delight.</p>
            <p>With different thoughts from the <hi>Cadi's</hi> ſailed
<hi>Ricardo,</hi>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:58406:89"/>and <hi>Mahamut.</hi> And ſo not being
willing to touch any where; as they went along on Land, they paſt by the
Towne of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> lanching through the deepe Gulfe; and without
ſtriking ſayle, or being driven to make uſe of their Oares, they came to
the ſtrong Iſland of <hi>Corſu,</hi> where they tooke in freſh water;
and preſently without any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtay, they paſſed by thoſe noted
high Cliffes, the <hi>Acroce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauros.</hi> And the ſecond day, they
diſcovered afar off <hi>Paquino,</hi> the <hi>Promontorie</hi> of the moſt
fertile <hi>Tinacria:</hi> out of whoſe ſight, and that famous Iſland of
<hi>Malta</hi> they went flying, for with no leſſe ſwiſtneſſe did
this happie bottome beare them.</p>
            <p>In fine, compaſſing that Iſland, ſome 4. daies after they
deſcried <hi>Lampadoſia,</hi> and anon after the Iſland where they had
like to have been wrack't, and the Galley wherein <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſa</hi> was
ſplit againſt the rocks, the very ſight wherof made her to tremble,
calling to mind the danger wherein ſhe had ſo lately ſeene her ſelfe.
The day following they might ken before them their deſired and beloved
Countrey, which quickned that ioy which was alreadie in their hearts; their
ſpirits were tranſported with this new co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentment, which is one of the
greateſt which can be had in this life, to arrive after a long captivity
ſafe in their owne native Countrey. And the next that may be equalled with
it, is that which men receive in getting the victory over their enemies.</p>
            <p>They found in the Galley a great cheſt full of flags and
ſtreamers of ſilk of ſundry colours, with which <hi>Ricardo</hi>
cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Galley to be adorned in moſt gallant manner. The day was but
newly broken, when as they found themſelves to be within leſſe then a
league of the Citie, and rowing luſtily, and ſending forth ever and anone,
ſhoutings of ioy and gladneſſe; they ſlacked their Oares the neerer
they came to the Haven, making in very leiſurely. In her entring into the
Port, an infinite number of people in an inſtant appeared; who having ſeene
how ſlowly that well trimmed Veſſell made to Land, there was not any 
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:58406:89" rendition="simple:additions"/>one in all the whole Citie, which did not come
forth haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the Sea ſide.</p>
            <p>Whileſt they were thus flocking to the ſhoare,
<hi>Ricardo,</hi> entreated <hi>Leoniſa</hi> that ſhee would cloath and
adorne her ſelfe in the ſame manner, as when ſhe entered into the Tent of
the <hi>Baſhaw's,</hi> becauſe hee would put a pretty jeaſt upon her
Parents<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> She did ſo, and adding gallantrie to gallantrie, Pearles, to
Pearles, and beautie, to beautie, (which the hearts contentment commonly
encreaſeth) ſhe attired and dreſt her ſelfe in ſuch ſort, as
cauſed a new admiration and wonder. <hi>Ricardo</hi> alſo put himſelfe
into the Turkiſh habit, the like did <hi>Mahamut,</hi> and all thoſe
Chriſtians that ply'de the Oare, for there were rayments enough of the
ſlaine <hi>Turkes</hi> to ſerve all of them. When they arrived at the Port,
it was about eight of the clocke in the morning, which ſhowed it ſelfe ſo
fair, and ſo cleare, that it ſeemed to appeare ſo of purpoſe, for to
behold that joyfull entrance.</p>
            <p>Before their entering the Port, <hi>Ricardo</hi> made them to
diſcharge their Peeces of Ordnance belonging to the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley; to wit, one
Canon, and two Falcons, the Citie an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered them with the like. The people
ſtood as thicke as they could ſtand together, expecting the comming in of
this goodly Veſſell, ſo bravely waving her flying flagges and
ſtreamers, moving too and fro with a gentle gale of winde. But when they were
come ſo neere them as to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne that they were <hi>Turkiſh,</hi> by
reaſon of thoſe white <hi>Turbants</hi> that they wore on their heads, they
beganne to waxe fearefull, and jealous of ſome fraud and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit. Whereupon
they betooke them to their Armes, and as many as were train'd Souldiers in the
Citie, haſtned to the Port, whileſt the Horſemen went ſome one way,
ſome another, ſcouring the coaſt. Of all which ſtirre they tooke great
pleaſure, who by little and little drew neerer and neerer till they entred
the Haven, and caſting anchor neere the ſhoare, throwing out a plank, and
pulling in their<pb n="174" facs="tcp:58406:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>Oares one by one, as it were in
proceſſion came on Land, which with teares of joy they kiſſed againe
and againe; an evident ſighe that they were Chriſtians, who had made prize
of that Veſſell. The laſt that landed, were the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother of
<hi>Halima,</hi> and her kinſmen, all (as wee told you) clad after the
<hi>Turkiſh</hi> faſhion. That which made up the totall ſumme or finall
end <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, was faire
<hi>Leoniſa,</hi> having a vayle caſt over her face of Crimſon Taffata,
led by <hi>Ricardo,</hi> and <hi>Mahamut;</hi> which ſpectacle drew after
them the eyes of all that infinite multitude, who at their landing
proſtrating themſelves as the reſt did, ſaluting the earth with their
kiſſes.</p>
            <p>By that time this was done, the Captaine and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the
Citie was come up unto them, who knew very well that they of all the reſt
were the chiefe and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall perſons. But he had ſcarce come fully neere
them, but preſently he knew <hi>Ricardo,</hi> and ranne with open arms, and
ſignes of exceeding great joy to embrace him.</p>
            <p>There came along with the governour <hi>Cornelio</hi> and his
Parents, and thoſe of <hi>Leoniſa,</hi> with all her kinsfolke, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with thoſe of <hi>Ricardo;</hi> all which were the greateſt Perſons of
rancke and qualitie in the whole Citie. <hi>Ricardo</hi> embraced the
Governour, and repayed them all with thanks, that gave him the
<hi>Parabien</hi> of his returne.</p>
            <p>He tooke <hi>Cornelio</hi> by the hand, who as ſoone as he knew
him, and found that he held him faſt, his colour began to change, and beganne
to ſhake and tremble for feare; and taking <hi>Leoniſa</hi> likewiſe by
the hand, he ſayd: Gentlemen, of curteſie (ſirs) I beſeech you, that
before wee enter the Citie, and into the Temple to give due thankes unto our
Lord God, for the great favours which he hath done for us in our misfortunes,
you will bee pleaſed to heare mee ſpeaker few words, which I am deſirous
to deliver unto you.</p>
            <p>Whereunto the Governour anſwered, that hee might utter what he
would; for they ſhould all with much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent<pb n="175" facs="tcp:58406:90"/>and
ſilence, give him both a willing, and attentive care. Preſently hereupon
all the chiefeſt amongſt them, placed themſelves round about him; and hee
raiſing his voyce to ſuch a height as he might (not overſtraining it) be
well heard, ſpake unto them after this manner.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, yee may well remember the misfortune which ſome
moneths ſince befell me in the Garden neere the Salt-pits, together with the
loſſe of <hi>Leoniſa;</hi> it cannot likewiſe have fallen out of your
memorie, the diligence which I uſed in procuring her libertie, ſince that
being forgetfull of mine owne, I offered for her ranſome all my whole
eſtate. And though this perhaps to your ſeeming, was then accounted great
<hi>Liberalitie,</hi> yet can it not, neither ought it to redound to my
praiſe, ſince that I was to give it for the ranſome of my ſoule. That
which from that time ſince hath happened to both of us, will require long
time, a more ſeaſonable conjuncture, and another tongue leſſe troubled
then mine. Let it ſuffice for the preſent that I tell you, that after many
various and ſtrange accidents, and after a thouſand loſt hopes of
remedying our misfortunes, Heaven taking pitie of us without any merit of ours,
hath returned us home to our native Countrey, as full of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, as abounding
in wealth: yet neither from this, nor my procured libertie is the end
anſwerable to my deſire; nor doe I take any great contentment in the
enjoying of theſe, but in that which I conceive, this both in peace, and war
my ſweet enemie taketh, as well for to ſee her ſelfe free, as to ſee
here before her (as ſhe doth) the image of her owne ſoule. Yet
notwithſtanding I greatly rejoyce in this generall rejoycing, which they
receive who have beene my companions in miſerie; and though hard
mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, and ſad miſchances are wont to alter our diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,
and to depreſſe valiant mindes. Yet was it not ſo with the overthrower of
my good hopes; for I may bee bold to ſay it, that ſhe amidſt theſe her
miſeries, hath with the more undaunted courage and conſtant reſolution,
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured<pb n="174" facs="tcp:58406:91"/>the ſhip wracke of her diſadventures, and the
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters of my earneſt, but honeſt importunings. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that old Adage
is verified; they may change their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, but not their Cuſtomes who
have once gotten a habite of them. Of all this which I have ſayd, I thence
inferre; that I offered my whole eſtate for her ranſome, gave her my
ſoule in my good deſires, plotted the meanes of her libertie, and
adventured more for her, then my ſelf, my life. And though from all theſe,
(in the conſtruction of noble, and ingenious diſpoſitions) may be
raiſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements of ſome moment, yet will I not preſſe any one upon
her, ſave onely this one which I preſume ſhe will make good; and in
ſaying this, he puts up his hand, and in a very civill and mannerly way,
tooke away the ſcarfe from before <hi>Leoniſa's</hi> face, which
reſembled as it were the removing of a cloud, which darkens the beautifull
bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Sunne. Then did he proſecute his ſpeech, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
Loe, here <hi>(Cornelio)</hi> I deliver unto thee ſuch a jewell, which thou
oughteſt to eſteeme above all thoſe things that are eſteemed worthie.
And ſo here (thou faire <hi>Leoniſa</hi>) I give thee that which thou
baſt ever had in thy memorie. This if you pleaſe you may tearme
<hi>Liberalitie:</hi> In compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whereof, to give away my eſtate, my
life, my honour, is all as nothing. Take her (oh thou fortunate yong man) take
her (I ſay;) and if thy knowledge can but come to reach ſo high as to come
to know her worth, I ſhall hold thee to be the happieſt man this day on
earth. Together with her, I will give thee likewiſe as much as comes to my
ſhare of all that which Heaven hath allotted to us all, which I make account
will come to above 30. thouſand Crownes. All this mayeſt thou freely enjoy
with much pleaſure, quietude, and content; and Heaven grant that it may
continue many long and happie yeares. As for my ſelfe, being made unfortunate
by ſome ſquint eyed ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re at
my birth, ſince that I muſt be without <hi>Leoniſa,</hi> I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to
be poore; for he lives too long who lives without <hi>Leoniſa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:58406:91"/>This ſayd, he was ſilent, as if he had
knit a knot upon his tongue. But within a very little while, before that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other ſpake, recollecting himſelfe, he ſaid; Oh Heavens! how do pinching
troubles diſturbe the underſtanding? I (gentlemen) out of the deſire
which I have to doe good, have not weighed well what I ſayd. For it is not
poſſible that a man ſhould ſhew himſelf liberall of that which is
anothers, not his owne. What juriſdiction or power have I in
<hi>Leoniſa,</hi> for to give her unto another? or how can I make offer of
that which is ſo farre from being mine? <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſa</hi> is his, and ſo
much his; that were her Parents dead, (but long may they live) her affection
would finde no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. And if there may ſtand perhaps in her way
thoſe obligations, which (being as ſhe is, diſcreet) ſhe ought to
thinke ſhe owes me; from this day forward I diſclaime them, cancell them,
and acknowledge them to be wholy voyd and of none effect; and therefore unſay
what I ſayd before. I give then to <hi>Cornelio</hi> nothing, becauſe I
cannot; onely I confirme the grant of my goods made to <hi>Leoniſa,</hi>
without deſiring or looking for any other recompence, ſave that ſhee
eſteeme for true my honeſt thoughts, and that ſhe will have this beliefe
of them, that they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver directed, nor looked towards any other point,
ſave that which ſtood with her incomparable honeſtie, her great worth,
and infinite beauty. And here <hi>Ricardo</hi> ended his ſpeech.</p>
            <p>Whereunto <hi>Leoniſa</hi> anſwered in this manner; if any
fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours (oh <hi>Ricardo</hi>) you imagine I did <hi>Cornelio</hi> (when as you
were enamoured and jealous of mee) imagine likewiſe, that it was both meete,
and honeſt, as being guided by the will and order of my Parents, who
intending to make a match betweene us; laid their command upon me to do him
thoſe favours. If you reſt ſatisfied with this, well may you ſatisfie
your ſelfe with that which experience hath made knowne unto you of my
honeſtie, and reſervednes. I ſpeake this, for to give you
<hi>(Ricardo)</hi> to underſtand, that my<pb n="176" facs="tcp:58406:92"/>will was
alwaies ſubject to anothers will; to wit, my Parents, whom I now moſt
humbly (as is meet) beſeech, and earneſtly entreat, that they will give me
leave and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, freely to diſpoſe of that which your valour and
<hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie</hi> hath beſtowed on mee. Her Parents with a very good will
gave her their leave ſo to do, relying on her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, that ſhe would
make uſe thereof in ſuch ſort, as ſhould redound alwaies to her owne
honour, and their profit.</p>
            <p>Having obtained this licence, diſcreet <hi>Leoniſa</hi>
proceeded thus. I ſhall entreate you (as many as be here preſent) that you
will beare me witneſſe, that I had rather incurre the cenſure of
lightneſſe, and inconſtancie, (which none of you all can, or ſhall ever
be able to charge me therewith) then to bee taxed (which is hatefull both in
the ſight of God and man) of unthankfulneſſe and ingratitude. And
therefore (oh valiant <hi>Ricardo</hi>) my good will and affection hitherto
ſo reſerved, ſo perplexed and doubtfull, ſhall now declare it ſelfe
in your favour. To the end, that you men may know that all women are not
ingratefull, by my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of my thankfulneſſe to you. I am thine
<hi>(Ricardo)</hi> and will bee thine till death, if ſome better knowledge
move thee not to deny me thy hand; for I deſire nothing more then to have
thee to be my Husband.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ricardo</hi> hearing theſe words, was ſo tranſported
with joy, and in a manner ſo beſides himſelfe, that hee neither knew how,
nor could not anſwer <hi>Leoniſa</hi> in any other lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage then humbling
himſelfe on his knees before her, and kiſſing her hands which hee held
faſt by force, bathing them often with his tender and loving teares.
<hi>Cornelio</hi> did ſhed teares too, but of griefe, and ſorrow; ſo did
<hi>Leoniſa's</hi> Parents, but of joy and gladneſſe; and of admiration
and contentment all the ſtanders by.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop of that Citie was then there preſent, and with his
Benediction, and Licence brought them to the Cathedrall Church, and
diſpenſing with the time, inſtantly<pb n="177" facs="tcp:58406:92"/>married them. The
joyfull newes of this wedding was quickly ſpread over all <hi>Trapana,</hi>
and that very night in token of rejoycing, infinite lights were ſet up, and
great bonfires made, accompanied with ringing of bells, and divers loud
muſicall inſtruments. And for many daies after there were Maskings,
Commedies, ſporting with Canes. running of Bulls, and ſolemne invitations
and feaſtings made by the Parents of <hi>Ricardo,</hi> and <hi>Leoniſa.
Mahamut,</hi> and <hi>Halima</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to the Church, who
impoſſibilited of fulfilling her deſire in being <hi>Ricardo's</hi> wife,
contented her ſelfe in matching with <hi>Mahamut.</hi> To <hi>Halima's</hi>
Parents and kinſmen <hi>Ricardo</hi> gave liberally of thoſe ſpoyles
which he had taken, wherewith they might be enabled to live, not onely
ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, but plentifully. In concluſion, all of them remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned fully
contented and ſatisfied; and the fame of <hi>Ricardo</hi> going beyond the
bounds of <hi>Sicily,</hi> ſpread it ſelfe through all the parts of
<hi>Italy,</hi> and many other places under the name of the <hi>Liberall
Lover.</hi> And even to this very day conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth freſh in thoſe many
Children which he had by <hi>Leoniſa,</hi> who was a rare example of

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N a hot ſummers night, there retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from recreating
themſelues at the river of <hi>Toledo,</hi> an ancient gentleman accompanied
with his Wife, a little young ſonne, a daughter of the age of 17. yeares, and
a maid-ſervant. The night was cleare and bright, the houre eleven, the way
open, and their pace ſlow, that they might not looſe through wearines,
thoſe pleaſures which the meadowes lying along the river ſide of
<hi>Toledo,</hi> did afford them. And relying on the ſecurity, which the
ſtrict courſe of Iuſtice, and the well diſpoſed people of that City
did promiſe, the good old gentleman went wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king leaſurely along with his
ſmall family, farre from any thought of the leaſt diſaſter that might
befall them. But forasmuch as misfortunes commonly then come when wee leaſt
thinke on them, contrary wholly to his thought and quite beyond all
imagination, there happened one which diſturbed their preſent pleaſure,
and gave them oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to weepe many yeares after. There was a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man 
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:58406:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>of that City about the age of 22. whom his great
wealth, his noblenes of blood, his depraved diſpoſition, his too much
aſſumed liberty, and the looſe and licentious company that hee kept, made
him to doe ſuch inſolent and extravagant actions as did ill beſeeme his
quality, and gave him the attribute of impudent, and inſolent.</p>
            <p>This gentleman then (whoſe name for good reſpects wee ſhall
conceale, and call <hi>Rodolpho</hi>) with foure other friends of his, all
young men full of iollitie, and aboue all exceeding inſolent, was comming
downe the ſame hill which the old gentleman was going up. Theſe two
companies met each other, that of the ſheepe, with that of the wolves, and in
a moſt uncivill kind of manner, voyde of all ſhame and honeſtie covering
their owne faces, they diſcovered thoſe of the mother, daughter, and Mayd:
the old man, (and I cannot blame him) was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what moved thereat, reproved
them for it, and told them they might be aſhamed (had they any
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>me in them) to offer ſuch an
affront to gentlewomen. They anſwered him with mocks and ſcoffes, and
without further miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning themſelues, they wont forward on their way.
But the great beauty of that faireſt which <hi>Rodolfo</hi> had ſeene,
which was that of <hi>Leocadia,</hi> (for that was the name of this gentlemans
daughter) began in ſuch ſort to bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in his memory that it drew
his affection after her, and ſtirred him up in a deſire to enioy her, in
deſpight of all inconveniences that might follow thereupon, and in an
inſtant, as ſudden as his paſſion, he imparted his mind to his
Companions, and both hee and they preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to returne backe, and
take her from her parents by force, onely therein for to pleaſe
<hi>Rodolfo,</hi> for your great and rich men, which are lewdly and
licentiouſly given ſhall never want thoſe that will canonize their evill
acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and qualifie their bad courſes for good. And therfore the hatching
of this wicked purpoſe, the communicating it, the approving of it, and the
reſolving upon it, to carry<pb n="181" facs="tcp:58406:94"/>away <hi>Leocadia,</hi> and
the putting of it in execution was done as it were all in an inſtant, they
covered their faces with their handkerchers, and drawing out their ſwords
they came backe, and had not gone many ſteps before they had overtaken
thoſe, who had not as yet fully made an end of giving thankes unto God for
having freed them from the hands of thoſe bold and inſolent perſons.
<hi>Rodolfo</hi> ſeazed on <hi>Leocadia,</hi> and taking her vp in his armes,
ran away with her, with all the haſt he could, who had not ſtrength enough
to defend her from this violence, and the ſudden paſſion that
poſſeſſed her was ſo prevalent that it tooke away the uſe of her
voyce, ſo that ſhe could not cry out, and likewiſe the light of her eyes,
ſince that ſhe being in a ſwound, and without any ſenſe, ſhee
neither ſaw who carried her, nor whether they did carry her. Her father cryed
out, the mother ſhreeked, her little brother wept and cryed both together,
the maid ſhe tare her haires and face; but neither their cryings nor
ſhreekings were heard, neither did their teares move compaſſion, nor the
tearing up of furrowes in their faces doe them any good. For the ſolitarines
of the place, the ſtill ſilence of night and the cruell bowels of the
malefactors, concurred to give way to this deed of darkenes. In a word the one
went their way glad and joyfull; and the other ſad and mournefull.
<hi>Rodolfo</hi> came home to his houſe without any let or hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: And
the parents of <hi>Leocadia</hi> to theirs grieved, affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and full of
deſpaire: They were blind wanting their daughters eyes, which were the light
of theirs; they were all alone lacking the ſweet &amp; pleaſing company of
<hi>Leocadia,</hi> they were confounded, and amazed, not knowing what to doe,
whether they ſhould give notice of their misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to the Iuſtice, or
not: They were fearfull leaſt in ſo doing, they ſhould bee the principall
inſtrument of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing their diſhonour: They ſaw themſelues
neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated for any matter of favour as being poore though nobly
deſcended. They knew not on whom to<pb n="182" facs="tcp:58406:95"/>complaine, but their
owne hard fortune. <hi>Rodolfo</hi> in the meane while, being ſubtill and
craftie brought <hi>Leocadia</hi> home to his houſe, and to his owne private
lodging. And though ſhe were in a ſwound when he carried her away; yet for
the more ſuretie did he blind-fold her eyes with a handkercher that ſhe
might not take notice of the ſtreets through which ſhe paſſed, nor of
the houſe nor lodging whereunto he had brought her, having put her thereinto,
without being ſeene of any bodie, becauſe hee had his quarter in his
fathers houſe (who was yet living) to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and kept the key of his
chamber doore himſelfe, and thoſe of that his whole quarter, <hi>An
unadviſed inconſiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Parents, to ſuffer their Sonnes to
live in that retyred manner, without witneſſes of their
converſation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before that <hi>Leocadia</hi> had recovered her ſwounding,
<hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolfo</hi> had ſatisfied his luſtfull deſire; for the unchaſte
vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences of youth ſieldome or never reſpect either time or place, but
runs on headlong whether their unbrideled luſt leades them, letting looſe
the reines to all licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Having the light of his underſtanding
thus blinded, he robbed <hi>Leocadia</hi> in the darke of the beſt jewell
that ſhe had. And for that the ſinnes of ſenſualitie reach no further
for the moſt part, then the accompliſhing and fulfilling of them
<hi>Rodolfo</hi> preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly reſolved to turn <hi>Leocadia</hi> out of doors,
and it entered into his imagination to lay her out in the ſtreet, being thus
in a ſwound as ſhe was, and going to put this his purpoſe in execution,
hee perceived that ſhee was newly come to her ſelfe, and began to ſpeake,
ſaying.</p>
            <p>Oh unfortunate wretch that I am! where am I? what darkeneſſe
is this? what clouds have compaſſed me about? Lord bleſſe mee, who is
that that toucheth me? am I in bed? what ayleth mee? how comes this to
paſſe? doe you heare me deare Mother? or you my beloved Father? Aye me,
unhappie as I am! for I well perceive that my Parents heare me not, and that my
enemies touch mee; happie ſhould I be if this darkneſſe would endure for
ever,<pb n="183" facs="tcp:58406:95"/>not giving my eyes leave to ſee any more the light
of the World. And that this place wherein now I am, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, might
ſerve to be the ſepulchre to my honour; ſince that better is that
diſhonour which is not knowne, then that honour which is expoſed to the
opinion of the vulgar. Now I call that to minde which before I could not, that
but a little while ſince, I was in the company of my Parents; now I remember
that ſome aſſaulted mee; now I conceive and ſee, that it is not meet
that the people ſhould ſee mee. Oh thou! whoſoever thou art that art here
with mee (and with this ſhee tooke faſt hold on <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſo's</hi> hands)
if thou beeſt ſuch a one whoſe ſoule will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of entreatie, I
entreat and beſeech thee, that ſince thou haſt triumphed over my
<hi>Fame,</hi> that thou wilt likewiſe tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over my life; quit me of it
inſtantly, for it is fit that I ſhould loſe my life, ſince that I have
loſt my honour; and conſider with thy ſelfe, that the rigour of that
crueltie which thou haſt exerciſed on mee in offending me, will be tempered
and moderated by the pitle which thou ſhalt uſe towards me by killing me;
and ſo thou ſhalt ſhow thy ſelfe at once, both cruell, and
pitifull.</p>
            <p>The reaſons which <hi>Leocadia</hi> alleadged to
<hi>Rodolfo,</hi> left him in amazedneſſe, and confuſion; and like a raw
yong man unexperienced in the world, hee knew not either what to ſay, or doe:
whoſe ſilence made <hi>Leocadia</hi> the more to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, who by her hands
ſought to diſ-deceive her ſelfe, and to try by touching whether it were a
phantaſma, or a ghoſt that was with her; but when ſhe found that ſhe
touched a bodie, a very bodie, and did call to her remembrance the force which
was done her going along with her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, ſhee fell into a true reckoning
of her misfortune; and with the very thought thereof, ſhee returned a new to
vent at thoſe words which her many ſighes and ſobbes bad incorrupted,
ſaying.</p>
            <p>Oh thou hold daring man! for thy actions make me to judge thee to
bee of no great yeares, I pardon thee the<pb n="184" facs="tcp:58406:96"/>wrong thou haſt
done me, and forgive thee that foule of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence thou haſt committed; ſo that
thou wilt promiſe and ſweare unto mee, that as thou haſt covered it with
this darkeneſſe, ſo likewiſe thou wilt cover it with perpetuall
ſilence, without acquainting any bodie therewith. It is a ſmall recompence
which I crave of thee, in compariſon of ſo great an injurie. Yet to mee
(conſidering the caſe that I am in) it will bee the greateſt that I can
begge of thee, or thou canſt give mee; conſider beſides, that I never
ſaw thy face, neither doe I deſire to ſee it. For though I cannot but
ſtill thinke on the offence done mee, yet will I not thinke upon my offender,
neither will I lay up in my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie the image of the authour of my hurt; I
ſhall poure forth my complaints between my ſelfe and Heaven, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
deſiring that the world ſhould heare them, which doth noujudge of things by
their ſucceſſe, but according unto that which is ſettled in it's
opinion. I know not how it is that I utter theſe truthes unto thee, which
uſually are wone to be grounded upon the experience of many Caſes, and on
the diſcourſe of many years, mine amounting to no more then 17; yet doe I
underſtand thus much, that griefe and for

               </gap>doth alike tye, and untye the tongue of the afflicted; one whiles
exuggerating the received wrong that others may be therby the better in duced
to beleeve it, and another whiles burying it in ſilence, that others may not
give any remedy thereunto. So that which way ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

               </gap> be, whether I ſpeake, or hold
my peace, I perſwade my ſelfe, that I cannot but move thee either to
beleeve mee, or to remedie me, ſince that not to beleeve me were ignorance,
and to remedie me impoſſible. Yet maiſt thou give me ſome little eaſe
of my griefe, whereof I will not deſpa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> is that which I will ſay onto thee;
ſee that thou doe not flatter thy ſelfe with expecting or hoping, that time
ſhall allay or pacifie that joſt reg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>nd in dignation which I beare, and ſtill ſhall towards thee;
neither doe thou goe<pb n="185" facs="tcp:58406:96"/>about to heape more wrongs upon mee,
becauſe thou art not likely further to enjoy me; and having already enjoyed
me, me thinkes thy evill deſires ſhould be the leſſe enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Make
account that thou offendeſt me by accident, without giving way to any good
diſcourſe, and I will make account that I was not borne and brought forth
into the world; or if I were, it was for to be unfortunate Put me therefore
preſently forth into the ſtreet, or at leaſt neere unto the great church,
for from thence I ſhal know how to go directly home. Moreover thou ſhalt
likewiſe ſwear unto me, that thou ſhalt not follow me, nor ſeek to know
where I dwel, nor ask me, neither my Parents, or mine own name, nor of my
kinsfolke, and Allies; who for that they are ſo rich, and ſo noble, they
may not be in me ſo unhappy, and unfortunate. Return me anſwer to theſe
my demands, and if thou art afraid that I may hap to know thee by thy voice, I
would have thee again to know, that excepting my father and my Confeſſor, I
have not ſpoken with any man in my life, and very few are they which I have
heard ſpeake in their ordinarytalk and communication that I could bee able to
diſtinguiſh them by the ſound of their voice.</p>
            <p>The anſwer which <hi>Rodoifo</hi> returned to the diſcreet
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of afflicted <hi>Leocadia,</hi> was no other ſave his
embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing her, and making ſhow that he had a minde to renew in himſelfe
his luſtfull deſire, and in her, her further diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; the which being
perceived by <hi>Leocadia,</hi> with greater force and reſiſtance then her
tender age could promiſe, ſhe defended her ſelfe with her feet, with her
hands, with her teeth, and with her tongue, ſaying.</p>
            <p>Know traytour as thou art, and thou wicked man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſoule or
conſcience whoſoever thou beeſt, that thoſe ſpoiles which thou haſt
had of mee, were ſuch as thou mightſt have taken from a ſtocke, or
ſtone, without any ſence or feeling; whoſe conqueſt and triumph which
can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but redound to thy reproach. And therfore that which thou pretondeſt,
thou ſhalt not obtain but by my death.<pb n="186" facs="tcp:58406:97"/>When I was in a
ſwound, thou took<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt thy
pleaſure, and didſt what thou liſteſt with me, but now that I am come
to my ſelfe, and have my ſpirits and wits about me, thou ſhalt ſooner
kill me, then overcome me; for if now being awake, I ſhould without
reſiſtance yeeld to thy abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble luſt, thou mighteſt (and not
without juſt cauſe) imagine that my ſwounding was feigned, when thou
waſt ſo bold and inſolent in working my utter ruine and
deſtruction.</p>
            <p>In concluſion, <hi>Leocadia</hi> ſo beſtirred her ſelfe,
and made ſuch ſtout and reſiſtance, that the ſtrength and courage,
and with it the deſires of <hi>Rodolfo</hi> began to flagge. And for that the
inſolencie which hee had uſed with <hi>Leocadia,</hi> had no other
beginning then from a violent laſcivious impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſnes, from which never
ſpringeth that true love which is permanent; but inſtead of that
impetuouſneſſe which paſſeth away, there remaineth onely repentance,
or at leaſt a coldneſſe of will to ſecond it. <hi>Rodolfo</hi> then
growing ſomewhat cooler, but much more wearie, without ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any one
word, left <hi>Leocadia</hi> in his bed and lodging, and went to ſeeke out
his companions, for to conſult and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe with them what he were beſt to
doe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leocadia</hi> perceived that ſhee was left all alone and
faſt ſhut up; whereupon riſing from the bed, ſhe went ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming about the
roome, groping the walls with her hands, for to ſee if ſhe could finde a
doore to get out at, or a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow to leape down. She found the doore, but too
ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lock't for her to open it, and ſhe lighted on a window which
ſhe was able to unhaspe, by which the Moone ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in ſo clear and ſo
bright, that <hi>Leocadia</hi> could diſtinguiſh the colours of certaine
Damasks which adorned the lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. She could diſcern that the bed was
guilded, &amp; ſo richly furniſhed, that it ſeemed rather the bed of a
Prince, then of a private gentleman. She reckoned the number of the ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>, and
ſtools, and of the <hi>Eſeritorios,</hi> and Cabinets; ſhe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the
place where the door ſtood, and though ſhe ſaw ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging on the
wals, yet ſhe diſcerned not the pictures<pb n="187" facs="tcp:58406:97"/>that were
drawne in them. The window was large, well garniſhed and guarded with a great
many barres, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect whereof was into a Garden, which was likewiſe
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed with high walls; difficulties which oppoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to that
intention which ſhe had to leape downe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſtreet. All that ſhe
ſaw and noted of the capaciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and rich furniture of the roome,
gave her to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that the Maſter and owner thereof muſt needes
bee ſome principall Perſon, and not of meane wealth, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding rich.
Vpon a Cabbinet which ſtood neere to the window, ſhe eſpied a little
<hi>Crucifix</hi> all of ſilver, the which ſhe tooke thence and put it in
her ſleeve, not out of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and as little out of theft; but onely
drawne unto it by a diſcreet deſigne which ſhe had in her head. This
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, ſhe ſhuts the window, leaving it as it was before, and
returned backe to the bed, expecting what end ſuch a bad beginning would
have.</p>
            <p>It was not to her ſeeming much more than halfe an houre, when
ſhe heard the doore of the lodging open, and that one came unto her, and
without ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much as one word, with a handkercher hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winked her
eyes, and taking her by the arme, tooke her out of the lodging, ſhe hearing
him ſhut the doore after him. This perſon was <hi>Rodolfo,</hi> who though
hee had gone to ſeeke out his Companions, yet was he not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to finde
them; it ſeeming unto him, that it was not fit that he ſhould have any
witneſſes of that which had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with that damoſel, but was rather
reſolved to tell them, that repenting himſelf of that ill deed, and moved
with her tears, hee had put her off, leaving her in the mid-way. Having thus
bethought himſelfe, hee returned backe with all ſpeed, to place
<hi>Leocadia</hi> neere unto the great Church, as ſhe had formerly entreated
of him before it were day, leaſt otherwiſe it might diſappoint his
pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and hee be enforced to keepe her in his lodging till the next
enſuing night; in which ſpace of time,<pb n="188" facs="tcp:58406:98"/>neither was he
willing to uſe any more force or violence, nor to give occaſion of being
knowne. Hee brought her then to the place which they commonly call by the name
of <hi>Ayumami<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nto,</hi> where the
people publickly aſſemble and meet together; and there in a counterfeit
voyce, and in a tongue halfe <hi>Portugheſe,</hi> and halfe
<hi>Spaniſh,</hi> hee told her that ſhe might thence goe ſecurely to her
owne houſe, and that none ſhould follow and tract her whether ſhee went.
And before that ſhe had time &amp; leiſure to unknit and looſen the
handkercher, he had got himſelfe farre enough out of her ſight.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leocadia</hi> remained all alone, ſhee tooke away the bend
from before her eyes, ſhee knew the place where hee had left her, ſhe
looked round about her on every ſide, ſhee ſaw no perſon living, but
ſuſpecting that ſome would follow her alooſe off, at every ſtep ſhe
made a ſtand, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing her ſelfe in that manner in her way homeward,
which was not very farre from the Church; and for to deceive the ſpies, if by
chance they ſhould follow her, ſhe entred into a houſe that ſhe found
open; and from thence by little and little went to her owne, where ſhe found
her Parents amazed and aſtoniſhed, and ſo farre from prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
themſelves to goe to bed, that they had not ſo much as entertained the
leaſt thought of taking any reſt at all; who, when they ſaw her, ran unto
her with open armes, and with tears in their eies, lovingly received her.
<hi>Leocadia's</hi> heart boyling with paſſion, and being much troubled in
minde, entreated her Parents to withdraw themſelves and to goe a little
aſide with her; they did ſo. And then, and there in a few words ſhe gave
them an account of that her unfortunate ſucceſſe, with all the
eircumſtances belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereunto, and that ſhe could by no meanes come to
the knowledge of him that aſſaulted her, and robb'd her of her honour, She
acquainted them with all that ſhee had

               </gap>eene in that Theater, wherein was

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ed that
woefull Tragedie of her misfortune. The win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, <pb n="189" facs="tcp:58406:98"/>the
garden, the barres of yron, the Cabinets, the bed, the Damaskes; and laſt of
all ſhe ſhewed them the <hi>Crucifice</hi> which ſhe had brought thence
with her. Before which Image they renewed their teares, made deprecations,
cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for vengeance, and begg'd of God miraculous cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements. She
likewiſe told them, that although ſhe did not deſire to come to have
knowledge of her offender, yet if it ſeemed good unto her Parents to have him
known by meanes of that Image, they might doe it by cauſing the Clerkes of
all the Pariſhes in the Citie, to publiſh at divine Service in their
ſeverall Churches, that hee who had loſt ſuch an Image, he ſhould finde
it put in the hands of ſome ſuch perſon as the party that loſt it
ſhould nominate and appoint for the receiving of it; and ſo by knowing the
ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Image, they might come thereby to know the houſe, as alſo the
perſon of their enemie. Hereunto her Father replied, what you have ſayd,
had beene well ſayd (Daughter) if the craftie and cunning now adaies did not
oppoſe it ſelfe to thy diſcreet diſcourfe, ſince that it is cleare
and manifeſt that this Image may not ſuddenly be miſt, or if miſt, no
great reckoning made of it; and the owner thereof will certainely apprehend and
imagine that the perſon who was with him in the lodging had taken it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;
and that if it ſhould come to his knowledge that ſome Religious man hath it
in his keeping, he will rather ſerve his turne, and make uſe of his knowing
who it ſhould be that gave it to him that now hath it, then bee willing to
declare and make knowne the owner that loſt it. And it may likewiſe happen
that another may come for it, to whom the owner thereof hath given ſome
ſigns and tokens whereby to know and challenge it to bee his. And if this
ſhould be ſo, we ſhould be in worſe caſe then before, and remaine
rather confounded, then informed, though wee ſhould uſe the ſame artifice
and cunning, which we ſuſpect them for, by giving it to a Religious man by
a third perſon. That (Daughter) which is herein <pb n="190" facs="tcp:58406:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>to be done, is to keepe it; that as it was a witneſſe of thy
diſgrace, ſo it may become an evidence to procure thee ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and
right the great wrong which thou haſt received. And with all conſider
(deare Daughter) that one ounce of publicke diſhonour doth lye heavier upon
us, then a pound weight of ſecret infamie. <hi>True diſhonour conſiſts
in ſinne, and true honour in virtue.</hi> God is offended with our ſayings,
our doings, and our deſires; and ſince that thou neither in thought, word,
nor deed, haſt offended him, account thy ſelfe honeſt, for I ſhall hold
thee ſo, and ſhall never looke upon thee but like a kinde and loving
Father.</p>
            <p>With theſe prudent reaſons did this good Father com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<hi>Leocadia;</hi> and her Mother embracing her againe, and againe, did
likewiſe endeavour to comfort her. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſhe fell a freſh a weeping,
and a crying, and hiding her head (as they ſay) for ſhame; ſhe betooke
her ſelfe to a private and retyred courſe of life, under the ſhelter and
protection of her Parents, being honeſtly, and decently, though but porely
clad.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rodolfo</hi> in the meane while being come home, and
ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him downe in his chamber, caſting his eye aſide, hee found the
Image of his <hi>Crucifix</hi> miſſing, and preſently ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined who might
carry it away; but he made ſlight of it, and for that he was rich, he did not
reckon much of it, neither did his Parents queſtion him for it; when as
(being within three dayes after to goo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> or <hi>Italy</hi>) he did deliver up by tale to one of his Mothers
Chambermaids, all that which hee left behinde him in the lodging, whereof
ſhee tooke a true Inventorie.</p>
            <p>It was many daies ſince that <hi>Rodolfo</hi> had reſolved to
tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell into <hi>Italy;</hi> and his Father who had beene there in his younger
yeares, perſwaded him thereunto; telling him, that they were not Gentlemen
who were onely ſo in their owne Countrey, but that they muſt likewiſe
ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be ſuch abroad. For theſe and other reaſons,
<hi>Rodolfo</hi> diſpoſed his will, to cumply with that of his father, 
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:58406:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>who gave him Bills of credit for good round
ſummes of money for <hi>Barcelona, Genoa, Rome,</hi> and <hi>Naples.</hi> And
he with two of his Comrad's preſently departed, being much ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with that
which he had heard ſome Souldiers repeate of the great ſtore of Inn's in
<hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie which
<hi>Spanyards</hi> tooke in their lodgings. That ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded well in his care;
loe ſir, here be good tender Pullets, young Pigeons, fine white fat Veale, a
good Gammon of Bacon, excellent Sauſages, and the like; which the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
did magnifie in mentioning them unto him; ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what a great deale of
difference they found when they came out of thoſe parts into theſe, laying
before him the ſcarcitie of Proviſion, and the diſcommodities of the
Inn's of <hi>Spaine.</hi> In concluſion, he went away, ſo little thinking
on that which paſſed betwixt himſelfe, and <hi>Leocadia,</hi> as if there
had never beene any ſuch matter.</p>
            <p>She in the <hi>interim,</hi> led her life in the houſe of her
Parents with all poſſible retyredneſſe, without ſuffering her ſelfe
to bee ſeene of any, as one that was fearefull, leaſt they might read her
misfortune in her forehead. But within a few moneths, ſhe perceived that
ſhe was driven to do that by force and conſtraint, which hitherto ſhe had
done wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, and of her owne accord. She ſaw that it was fit and
convenient for her to live cloſely, and retyredly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe found her
ſelfe to bee with Childe. A ſucceſſe which occaſioned thoſe teares
which in ſome ſort had beene forgotten, to breake forth a new from the
fountains of her eyes; and thoſe ſighes and lamentations which had layen
for a while calme, and quiet, began to riſe, and like fierce windes, fell a
beating, and waging war one againſt another; her Mothers diſcretion, and
gentle perſwaſions, not being able to allay the violence of her
paſſion, nor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford her any comfort.</p>
            <p>Time fled away with a ſwift wing, and the time of her delivery
was come; but with that ſecreſie, that they durſt not truſt a Midwife
therewith, ſo that her Mother uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping<pb n="192" facs="tcp:58406:100"/>this office,
brought forth to the light of the world a little young Son, one of the
prettieſt, ſweeteſt, and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifulleſt babes that thought it ſelfe
could imagine; with the like warineſſe, circumſpection, and ſecreſie
w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>erwith it was borne, they
conveyed it to a Countrie Village, where it continued foure yeares. At the end
whereof, with the name of Nephew his Grandfather brought him home to his owne
houſe, where he was bred up, though not very richly, yet at leaſt very
vertuouſly. The Childe was (whom they named <hi>Luys,</hi> that being his
Grandfathers name) of a fayre complexion, a. pleaſing countenance, a ſweet
diſpoſition, a gentle nature, a quicke wit; and in all thoſe his actions
which in that tender age he could do, he gave apparant ſignes and tokens,
that he was begotten by ſome noble Father; and in ſuch ſort his wit,
beautie, and prettie behaviour, did make his Grandfather and Grandmother ſo
farre in love with him, that they came to hold their Daughters
unhappineſſe, to be a happineſſe, in that ſhe had given them ſuch a
Nephew. When hee went through the ſtreet they did ſhowre downe upon him a
thouſand benedictions; ſome bleſſed his beautie, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome the
Mother that bare him, theſe, the Father that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat, and thoſe, him who had
brought him up, and given him ſuch good breeding.</p>
            <p>With this applauſe of thoſe that knew him, and knew him not,
the Child grew to bee Seven yeares of age. In which time he had learned to read
Spaniſh, and Latine, and to write a very good hand. For his grandfathers and
grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothers intention was to make him virtuous, and wiſe, ſince that they
could not make him rich; not being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, <hi>that virtue, and wiſedome,
were the onely riches over which neither theeves, nor fortune had any
power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It happened one day, that the Child was ſent by his Grandmother
on a meſſage to a kinſwoman of hers, and it was his chance to paſſe
through a ſtreet where ſome gentlemen were running carcers with their
horſes, he ſtaied<pb n="193" facs="tcp:58406:100"/>to looke on them, and for the
getting of a better place; he ran athwart from the one ſide, to the other,
juſt in ſuch an ill conjuncture of time, that he could not avoyd a
Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes running over him, whoſe rider with all the ſtrength he had, was
not able to keepe backe in the furie of his Careere. He ranne over him, and
left him ſtretcht on the ground for dead, pouring out much bloud from his
head.</p>
            <p>This ſad miſchance had ſcarce happened, when loe, an ancient
Gentleman, who was beholding the Careere, with extraordinarie dexteritie leapt
from his Horſe, and went where the Child was; and taking him out of ones
armes that held him, tooke him into his owne, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making any reckoning
of his grey haires, or regarding his authoritie, which was much, neglecting the
grave Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh pace, with large ſteps he hyed him home to his own houſe,
willing his ſervants to leave him, and to goe and ſeeke out a skilfull
Surgeon for to cure the Childe. Many Gentlemen followed him, grieving and
pittying the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune that had befallen ſo ſweete and fayre a Childe.
For it was preſently voyced abroad, that hee that was thus troden downe, was
<hi>Luiſico,</hi> the kinſman of ſuch a Gentleman, naming his
Grandfather. This voyce ranne from mouth to mouth, till it came at laſt to
the eares of his grandfather, and grandmother, and likewiſe to thoſe of his
retyred Mother; who being fully and truely certified of this unluckie and
lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table accident, ranne forthwith out of doores as if they had beene mad,
to know what was become of their beloved. And becauſe the gentleman that
carried him away, was ſo well known, and of ſuch principall rank and
quallitie, many of thoſe whom they met withall told them where his houſe
was, whether (being carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween love and feare) they ſoon arrived juſt
at that inſtant when the Child was under the Surgeons hands. The gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
&amp; his wife, the owners of the houſe, entreated thoſe 
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:58406:101"/>whom they thought to bee his Parents, that they would not
weepe, nor fill the ayre with the crie of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, being that it
could doe the Childe no good. The Surgeon who was famous for his skill, having
dreſſed him with a gentle hand, and as a Maſter of his facultie, told
them that the wound was not ſo mortall, as at firſt he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it had
beene.</p>
            <p>When hee was halfe dreſt, <hi>Luiſicos</hi> memorie came to
him, which untill then had left him; and was very glad and cheerie, in ſeeing
his Grandfather and Grandmother there, who with teares in their eyes, asked him
how hee did? He anſwered, well, ſave that he was much pained in his bodie,
and his head. The Surgeon adviſed them, that they ſhould not ſpeake unto
him, but that they would give him leave to take his reſt. They did ſo; and
then his Grandfather beganne to give the Maſter of the Houſe thankes, for
that his great charitie which he had extended towards his Nephew. Whereunto the
gentleman replied, that he needed not to thanke him; giving him to
under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that when the Childe fell, and was over-borne by the Horſe, it
ſeemed unto him, that hee ſaw the face of a Sonne of his owne, whom hee
tenderly loved; and that this moved him to take him up in his armes, and bring
him home to his owne houſe, where hee would that hee ſhould continue till
hee were fully cured; and that hee ſhould not want cheriſhing, nor any
thing elſe that the houſe could afford, that was needfull and
neceſſarie for him. His Wife who was a noble Ladie, ſayd (the phraſe a
little varied) in effect the very ſame words, and did ſomewhat more
amplifie and endeare her promiſes.</p>
            <p>The grandfather and grandmother of the Childe did much wonder at,
and admire this their great Chriſtianitie. And the Mother much more, for her
troubled ſpirit being ſomewhat quieted by the Surgeons cofortable words,
ſhe diligently obſerved the lodging where her Son lay, and by 
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:58406:101"/>apparant ſignes and tokens, clearely knew that that was
the roome where her honour had it's end, and her misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune it's beginning.
And though it were not now hung and adorned with Damaske, as then it was; ſhe
knew the forme and faſhion of it, ſhee ſaw the window with the yron
barres which looked into a Garden; and though it were ſhut that the Ayre
might not offend the wounded Child, ſhe did aske whether that window did Butt
or no upon ſome garden? and it was told her, it did; but that which ſhe
moſt certainly knew, was, that that was the very ſame bed which had beene
the Tombe-ſtone to her grave. And moreover, that that very Cabinet whereon
ſtood the <hi>Crucifix</hi> which ſhe ccarrieed away with her, remained
ſtill in the ſelfe ſame place. Laſtly, the ſtayres brought to light
the truth of all her ſuſpitions, which ſhe had numbered and counted when
ſhe was led out of the lodging blinde-fold; I ſay thoſe ſtayres which
were from her going out thence to the ſtreet, which with diſcreet
adviſement ſhee had told. And when ſhe came home (having taken leave of
her Son) ſhe fell to counting of them againe, and found the number of them to
fall out right, and juſt; and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſome ſignes with other ſome,
ſhee was fully perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that this her imagination was undoubtedly true.
Whereof ſhe gave a large account unto her Mother, who like a diſcreet
woman, informed her ſelfe whether this Gentleman where her Nephew now was,
had any Son, or no? And ſhe found that he whom we call <hi>Rodolſo</hi> was
his Son, and that he was in <hi>Italy.</hi> And caſting up the time, which
(as it was told them) hee had beene abſent from <hi>Spayne;</hi> they ſaw
that they jumped juſt with the ſame yeers of the Child. Shee gave notice of
all this to her Husband, and betwixt them two, and their Daughter, they agreed
to expect how God would diſpoſe of the wounded Child, who within fifteene
dayes was out of danger of his recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved hurt, and at the end of thirtie, was
upon his feet, and able to walke up and downe the chamber. In all which 
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:58406:102"/>time, he was viſited by his Mother, and Grandmother,
and made as much of by the owners of the houſe, as if hee had beene their
owne Child.</p>
            <p>And now and then, <hi>Dona Eſtefania</hi> (for ſo was the
Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemans wife called) talking with <hi>Leocadia,</hi> told her, that this
Child did ſo well refemble a Son of hers who was in <hi>Italy,</hi> that
ſhee never look't upon him, but that it ſeemed unto her that ſhe had her
own Son in her eye. From theſe words of hers, <hi>Leocadia</hi> tooke
occaſion on a time to tell her when ſhee was all alone with her, ſuch
things as had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beene debated and agreed upon by her Parents to
ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie unto her, which were theſe, or the like.</p>
            <p>That day (Madam) wherein my Parents heard that their Nephew was
ſo grievouſly hurt, they beleeved, and verily thought that Heaven had beene
ſhut againſt them, and that all the World had fallen upon them; they
imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that they had loſt the light of their eyes, whom they loved ſo
dearely, and in ſuch an extraordinary kinde of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, that by many degrees
it exceeded that which Parents commonly beare to their owne Children. But (as
we uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſay) that <hi>when God gives the wound, hee likewiſe gives
the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine to cure it.</hi> This Child hath found it in this houſe, and I
likewiſe therein call to minde ſome things which I ſhall never forget the
longeſt day of my life. I (deare Lady) am noble, becauſe my Parents are
ſo, and ſo have beene all my Aunceſtours; who with a mediocricie of the
goods of fortune, have happily upheld their honour and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whereſoever they lived.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dona Eſtefania</hi> was ſtrucken both with wonder, and
ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion, heakening to <hi>Leocadia's</hi> diſcourſe, and how
feeling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly her words came from her, and could not beleeve though ſhe ſaw
it, that ſo much diſcretion could bee comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in ſo few yeares,
judging her to be but ſome 20. years of age, little more, or leſſe; and
without ſaying any thing unto her, or replying ſo much as one word, ſhe
ſtood ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting to heare what ſhe would furthermore ſay, which 
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:58406:102"/>was ſufficient enough for the informing her of her Sons
waggiſhneſſe, and wantoneſſe, and of her own diſgrace, and
diſhonour; of his ſtealing, and carrying her away by force, of his
blind-folding of her eyes, of his bringing her to that very lodging, and
telling her the ſignes and tokens whereby ſhe certainely knew that the
ſame was the roome which ſo ſtrongly confirmed her ſuſpitition. For
further confirmation whereof, ſhe tooke from out her boſome the Image of
the <hi>Crucifix</hi> which ſhee had taken thence, and ſpake thus.</p>
            <p>Thou Lord, who waſt a witneſſe of the force that was offered
me; doe thou judge my cauſe, and make mee that amends and reparation of my
honour, as of right is due unto me. From the top of that Cabinet I tooke this
<hi>Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix,</hi> with a purpoſe onely to put me ſtill in minde of the
wrong I received, but not to crave vengeance thereof, (for I pretend no ſuch
thing) onely I ſhall entreat and begge of thee, that thou wilt give me ſome
comfort, whereby I may the better bee enabled to beare this my diſgrace with
patience.</p>
            <p>This Child (Ladie) on whom you have exerciſed the utmoſt of
your charitie, is your true Grandchild; it was Gods will and the permiſſion
of Heaven, that the Horſe ran over him, to the end, that by his being brought
to your houſe, that I ſhould finde that therein which I hope to finde; and
if not the remedie, which is moſt convenient for the curing of my
misfortunes, yet at leaſt the meanes which may helpe me to beare it the
better.</p>
            <p>Having ſayd this, ſhe fell downe in a ſwound in <hi>Dona
Eſtefania's</hi> armes; who like a noble Gentlewoman, (in whom
compaſſion, and pittie is as naturall, as crueltie in men,) had ſcarce
perceived <hi>Leocadia's</hi> ſwounding; but ſhee joyned her cheekes to
hers, ſhedding thereon ſo many teares, that there was no need of
ſprinkling any other wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in her face to bring her againe to her ſelfe.
Theſe two being thus glutd each to other, it was <hi>Dona Eſtefania's</hi>
Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands<pb n="198" facs="tcp:58406:103"/>hap to come into the roome, bringing
<hi>Luiſico</hi> in with him, leading him by the hand, and ſeeing
<hi>Eſtefania</hi> weepe, and <hi>Leocadia</hi> lying in a ſwound, he was
very haſty in inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what might bee the cauſe thereof, and whence it
proceeded. The Child embraced his Mother as his Coſen, and his Grandmother,
as his benefactreſſe; and did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe aske why they did weepe? Great
and ſtrange things (Sir) I have to tell you, ſayd <hi>Eſtefania</hi> to
her Husband; the whole ſumme whereof ſhall end in telling you, that I
muſt aſſure you that this gentlewoman who fell into a ſwound, is your
Daughter, and this pretty boy, your grandchilde. This truth which I tell you,
was delivered unto mee by this good gentlewoman, and the countenance of this
ſweet Child hath confirmed it; wherein we have both of us beheld as in a
glaſſe our owne Son. If you tell mee no more then this Wife, replied her
Husband, I doe not underſtand you. By this time <hi>Leocadia</hi> was come to
her ſelfe, and holding faſt ſtill the <hi>Crucifix,</hi> ſhee ſeemed
to bee turned into a ſea of teares. All which had put the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man into a
great confuſion and amazement, from which he was freed by his Wifes
recounting unto him all that which <hi>Leocadia</hi> had imparted unto her; and
he by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine permiſſion of Heaven, did beleeve it as verily, as if it
had been proved and made good by many ſubſtantiall and true
witneſſes.</p>
            <p>Hee comforted and embraced <hi>Leocadia,</hi> and kiſſed his
grandchilde <hi>Luiſico;</hi> and that very day diſpatched a Poſt to
<hi>Naples,</hi> adviſing his Son to come home with all poſſible ſpeed,
becauſe he had concluded a marriage for him, with a marvellous faire and
beautifull gentlewoman; and ſuch a one, as was moſt fit and convenient for
him. Nor would they by any meanes conſent, and give way, that
<hi>Leocadia,</hi> or her Childe ſhould backe againe to her Fathers houſe;
who reſting beyond meaſure contented with this good ſucceſſe of their
Daughter, gave infinite thankes therefore unto God. The Poſt returned from
<hi>Naples,</hi> and <hi>Rodolfo</hi> out<pb n="199" facs="tcp:58406:103"/>of
greedineſſe to enjoy ſo faire a Wife as his Father had ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified unto
him, within two dayes after that hee had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his Fathers letters,
occaſion of paſſage being offered unto him for his comming into
<hi>Spayne;</hi> taking hold there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he embarqued himſelfe, with his two
Comrades who had never left him, and with a proſperous wind, in 12. daies he
arrived at <hi>Barcelona;</hi> and from thence, taking Poſt-horſes, in 7.
more he came to <hi>Tolledo,</hi> and entered into his fathers houſe in
ſuch a brave and gallant faſhion as did exceed; for in him were met
together the extreames of both. His Parents were very much joyed with the
welfare and arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall of their Sonne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leocadia,</hi> who unſeene, from a private place had a full
view and ſight of him, that ſhe might not tranſgreſſe the order given
her by <hi>Dona Eſtefania,</hi> was in a quandarie, and in great doubt and
ſuſpenſion what would bee the iſſue of this buſineſſe.
<hi>Rodolfo's</hi> Comrades would needes goe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently home to their owne
houſes; but <hi>Eſtefania</hi> would by no meanes let them, becauſe ſhe
had need of them for the effecting of her deſigne. It was neere night when
<hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolfo</hi> arrived; and whileſt that ſupper was making readie,
<hi>Eſtefania</hi> called her Sons Comrades aſide, being verily
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that theſe muſt needes be two of thoſe three, who (as
<hi>Leocadia</hi> had told her) accompanied <hi>Rodolfo</hi> that night when
they ſtole her away; and with great and earneſt entreaties, ſhee
beſought them that they would tell her, whether they did not or no remember
that their Son on ſuch a night, ſo many yeares ſince ſtole away ſuch
a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man? For to know the truth thereof much concerned the honour and peace, of
not onely his Parents, but of all their Alliance and kindred. And with ſuch
and ſo great endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſhe knew how to crave this courteſie of them,
and in ſuch ſort to aſſure them, that from the diſcovering of this
ſtealth, there ſhould no dammage follow thereupon; that in concluſion,
they held it fit to confeſſe the truth, and ſo told her, that they two,
and another friend of <hi>Rodolfo's</hi>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:58406:104"/>on a Summers
night, the very ſame which ſhe had named unto them; had ſtollen away a
young gentlewoman, and that <hi>Rodolfo</hi> carried her away with him,
whileſt they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the reſt of their company, who without cries
ſought to defend her from that violence. And that the next day following
<hi>Rodolfo</hi> told them, that he carried her to his lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and that this
was all that they could ſay in anſwer to her demand.</p>
            <p>The confeſſion of thoſe two, was the key which ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the
doore to all the deubts, which in ſuch a caſe could offer themſelves; and
therefore ſhe reſolved with herſelf, to bring that good purpoſe which
ſhe had entertained, to a good end, which was this. A little before that they
were to ſit downe to ſupper, <hi>Rodolfo's</hi> Mother went apart with her
Sonne into a by-roome, and putting a picture into his hands, ſhe ſayd
withall unto him; Sonne <hi>Rodolfo,</hi> I will give you a very ſavoury and
pleaſing ſupper, in ſhewing thee thy Spouſe. This is her true picture;
but I muſt tell you, and would have you to thinke well upon it; that what is
wanting unto her in beautie, is ſuperabundantly ſupplied with her vertues.
She is noble, and diſcreet, and indifferently rich; and ſince that your
Father and my ſelfe, have made choice of her for you, aſſure your ſelfe
that ſhe is ſuch a one as is fitting for you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rodolfo</hi> viewed the picture with a ſearching and
judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous eye; and after hee had done looking upon it, he ſaid; if Painters
who commonly are wont to bee prodigall of their beſtowing of beauty on
thoſe faces which they draw, have dealt ſo likewiſe with this, I dare bee
bold to ſay it, and verily beleeve it, that the origin all to this
counterfeit, muſt needes bee fouleneſſe it ſelfe. In good faith (Ladie
Mother) it is juſt and meete that Children ſhould obey their Parents in all
that they ſhall command them; but withall it is likewiſe convenient, and
much more fitting, that Parents ſhould put their Children into ſuch an
eſtate and condition <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſhall
give them content, and in a lawfull <pb n="201" facs="tcp:58406:104"/>way ſtand with
their liking. And ſince that Marriage is a knot which is not undone but by
death; it were not amiſſe, but rather much to bee deſired, that the laces
wherewith this knot is to bee knit, ſhould bee equall and alike, and wrought
of one and the ſame threds. Vertue, nobleneſſe, diſcretion, and the
goods of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, may well pleaſe and delight the underſtanding of him who
ſhall happen to have a wife ſo quallified. But that the fouleneſſe of
ſuch a one ſhould cheere and glad the eies of her husband, in my opinion it
is impoſſible. I am but a young man, yet I underſtand my ſelfe very
well in this particular, and know that a juſt and due delight which married
folkes may enjoy and take one in other, may ſort and ſtand very well with
the rites of holy Matrimonie; and if that once fayle and be wanting,
Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie haltes and goes lame, and contradicteth it's ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
intention.</p>
            <p>Now then to thinke or imagine, that a foule face which a man is to
have at all houres before his eyes at bed, and at boord, may pleaſe and
delight; I ſay againe and againe, that I hold it impoſſible. Therefore as
you are my deare and loving Mother, I humbly beſeech you, that you will give
mee ſuch a companion, and yoake-fellow, that I may take ſome delight in
entertaining the time with her; and not ſuch a one as may cauſe a loathing
in me as oft as I ſhall looke upon her; to the end that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſting or
turning away to this or that other ſide, equally, and in a direct way, wee
may both of us the more eaſily draw together, and beare that yoake the
better, which Heaven hath allotted and layd upon us. And if this Gentlewoman be
noble, diſcreet, and rich, (as your Ladiſhip implieth) ſhe cannot want a
husband that may happily be of a different humour from
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e. Some there be, that ſeeke
after noblenes, others diſcretion, others money, others beauty, and I am of
the laſt. For noblenes, (thankes unto Heaven, my aunceſtors, and my
Parents) that is left to<pb n="202" facs="tcp:58406:105"/>mee by inheritance. For
diſcretion, ſo as a woman bee not an ignorant, an Aſſe, or a Dolte; it
ſufficeth that ſhee doe not breake (as they ſay) her needles point; that
ſhee bee not ſo witty, as by the ſubtilneſſe thereof, to runne into
ſome abſurditie or other to her ſhame and diſhonour; ſo fooliſh,
that ſhee ſhould not bee of ſome good uſe, and profit. For riches,
thoſe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of my Parents make me not to be fearefull of ever comming
to bee poore. It is beautie that I ſeeke after, it is one that is fayre and
well favoured, that I deſire; not regarding any other Dowrie then honeſtie,
and a ſweet and faire behaviour: for if my wife ſhall bring this with her,
I ſhall ſerve God with pleaſure and delight, and give a good and
contented old age to my Parents.</p>
            <p>His Mother reſted very well ſatisfied with <hi>Rodolfo's</hi>
rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, becauſe by them ſhee knew that it made all as ſhee would have
it for her deſigne. And therefore made him anſwer, that ſhe would procure
ſuch a marriage for him, as ſhould be anſwerable to his deſire, and
that hee ſhould not trouble or afflict himſelfe a bout it; for it was an
eaſie peece of buſineſſe to undoe that agreement which was made for his
marrying with that gentlewoman <hi>Rodolfo</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred her many thanks, and
the hour of ſupper being come, they went forth to ſupper, and the father
and mother and <hi>Rodolfo</hi> and his Comrades being already ſate down at
table, <hi>Dona Eſtefania,</hi> as if ſhe had forgotten her ſelfe, O Lord
(quoth ſhe) where was my minde? have I not uſed my gueſt kindly think
you, to ſit down before ſhe comes? go one of you preſently, and tell
<hi>Leocadia,</hi> that without uſing any nicetie, or excuſing her ſelfe
that here are ſtrangers, ſhe come preſently hither to honour this my
Table; and that they who ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t at
it, are all of them my Children, and her ſervants. All his was her plott, and
of all that which was therein to bee done, <hi>Leocadia</hi> had beene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
advertiſed. It was not long ere <hi>Leocadia</hi> came and entered the roome,
preſenting on the ſudden in her<pb n="203" facs="tcp:58406:105"/>perſon the fayreſt
ſhow, that either artificiall, or naturall beautie could afford. Shee came in
clad, (it being then Winter,) in a gowne of blacke Velvet, ſet with but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons
of gold, and pearle; a girdle, and chaine of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, her owne haires which
were long, and of an auborne colour, did ſerve her inſtead of her
head-dreſſings, whoſe invention of ribbands, tufts of feathers, and
glitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of Diamonds which were interwoven with them, did dazle the eyes of
the beholders.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leocadia</hi> was of a gentle diſpoſition, and of a quicke
and lively ſpirit; ſhe brought her Son along with her, leading him by the
hand, two Damoſells going before her, lighting her in with two waxe lights,
in two ſilver Candleſtickes. They alroſe up to do her reverence, as if
ſhe had been ſome Deitie ſent downe from Heaven, which had thus
miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly appeared unto them. None of thoſe that were there, but
ſtood aſtoniſhed, beholding ſo rare a peece; and the more they looked
on her, the more they were amezed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that they were not able to
ſpeake unto her; ſuch power hath beauty to impoſe ſilence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leocadia,</hi> with a gracefull behaviour, and diſcreet
car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, made lowly curtiſie and obeyſance to them all; and
<hi>Eſtefania</hi> taking her by the hand, ſate her next un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her ſelfe,
right over againſt <hi>Rodolfo.</hi> The little boy, hee ſate by his
Grandfather; <hi>Rodolfo</hi> who now at a neerer diſtance, beheld the
incomparable beauty of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadia,</hi> ſayd within himſelfe; if ſhee
had but the one halfe of this beautie which my Mother hath made choyce of for
to bee my Spouſe, I ſhould hold my ſelfe the happieſt man in the World.
What is this which I now ſee? is it happily ſome Angell that I ſtand thus
gazing on? And in this rapture of his, the faire image of <hi>Leocadia</hi>
went entring in by his eye, to take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of his ſoule. Who all
the while that ſupper laſted, ſeeing him likewiſe ſo neere unto her
ſelfe, whom ſhee now loved more then the light of thoſe her eies which
now<pb n="204" facs="tcp:58406:106"/>and then by ſtealth looked on him, ſhe began to
revolve in her imagination, and to call to minde that which had paſſed
heretofore with <hi>Rodolfo.</hi> Whereupon thoſe hopes began to waxe weake
in her ſoule, which his Mother had given her of his being her Husband;
ſearing that the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of her fortune would be anſwerable in
the end to his Mothers promiſes. She conſidered with her ſelfe how neere
ſhe was of being happie, or unhappie for ever. And ſo intenſe was this
conſideration, and ſo ſtrong and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent theſe her thoughts and
imaginations, that they did in ſuch ſort trouble and oppreſſe her
heart, that ſhe began to ſweat, and to change colour in an inſtant;
whereupon ſuddenly followed a ſwounding, which enforced her to let her head
fall into <hi>Dona Eſtefania's</hi> lappe, had ſhe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it within
her armes. Who as ſoone as ſhe ſaw her in this trance, much ſtartled
therewith, made her boſome her pillow.</p>
            <p>A ſudden paſſion ſeized on them all, and riſing from the
boord, they addreſſed themſelves to procure her reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie. But he who
gave beſt evidence of his ſorrow was <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolfo,</hi> who that the
ſooner he might come in to helpe her, out of meere haſte ſtumbled, and
ſell twice; but neither with unclaſping her gowne, nor unlacing her
petticote, nor with ſprinkling water on her face, did ſhe come again to her
ſelfe, but rather the riſing of her breaſt, and the fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of her
pulſe, which they could not finde to move, or ſtirre, went giving preciſe
ſignes, and apparant tokens of her death. And the men and mayd-ſervants of
the houſe, more paſſionate, then well adviſed, cryed out aloud, on
ſhe is dead, ſhe is dead.</p>
            <p>This ſorrowfull newes, accompanied with ſuch woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
lamentations, came at laſt to the eares of <hi>Leocadia's</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; whom
for a more pleaſing occaſion, <hi>Dona Eſtefania</hi> had kept cloſe
and ſecret, till ſhe ſaw a fit time for to bring them forth in publicke;
who together with the Prieſt of the Pariſh, (for he likewiſe was ſhut
up with them,) break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<pb n="205" facs="tcp:58406:106"/>the order given them by
<hi>Eſtefania,</hi> came forth into the roome where they were. The Prieſt
made in quickly, for to ſee if by any ſignes, ſhe gave any tokens of
repenting her ſelfe of her ſinnes, to the end that he might abſolve her
of them. And whereas he thought to have found but one in a ſwound, he found
two. For <hi>Rodolfo</hi> was now in the like caſe, lying with his face on
<hi>Leocadia's</hi> breaſt; his Mother gave way unto him, and was willing
that hee ſhould draw thus neere unto her, as unto a thing that was to bee
his; but when ſhe ſaw that her Son likewiſe was without ſenſe, and
lay as it were for dead, ſhe was likewiſe upon the point to loſe hers;
and had queſtionleſſe loſt it, had ſhe not preſently perceived that
<hi>Rodolfo</hi> began (as hee did) to come againe to himſelfe; who was much
aſhamed that they had ſeene him run into ſuch extreames.</p>
            <p>But his Mother, as one that divined of that which her Sonne
thought, ſayd unto him; be not aſhamed (Sonne) of theſe extreames which
thou haſt committed, but bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of thoſe which thou ſhouldſt
not have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when thou ſhalt come to know that which I will no longer
conceale from thee, though I thought to have deferred the doing of it, untill a
more joyfull conjuncture.</p>
            <p>I would have thee therefore to know (Son of my ſoule) that this
gentlewoman whom you ſee lying thus in a ſwound in mine armes, is thy true
Spouſe. I ſtyle her thy true Spouſe, becauſe my ſelfe and thy Father
have made choyce of her to be thy wife; for that which I preſented to thee in
the picture, was a falſe one.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Rodolfo</hi> heard this, transported with his amorous,
and enflamed deſire; and the name of Husband removing all thoſe rubbes
which the honeſtie and decencie of the place might lay in his way, he brake
through the company, and laying his face to that of <hi>Leocadia,</hi> remained
as one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting that his ſoule ſhould breathe it ſelfe forth, and
ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bring hers backe againe, or make it's abode with hers for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:58406:107"/>But when the teares of all, through extreame
griefe, went ſtill more and more encreaſing; and when through exceſſe
of ſorrow, their lamentations and out-cryes augmented more and more, and grew
lowder and higher, and that the hayres of the head and beard of
<hi>Leocadia's</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Father, by taring and pulling of them up by
the rootes, beganne to waxe leſſe and leſſe, and that the ſhrill
exclamations of their Sonne <hi>Rodolfo,</hi> with their noyſe and clamour
peirced the Heavens. <hi>Leocadia</hi> returned againe unto her ſelfe; and
with her returning to life, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned that joy and content, which had
abſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the breſts of thoſe that were about her.
<hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadia</hi> ſound her ſelfe linked cloſe with faſt embracings in
<hi>Rodolfo's</hi> armes, and ſought by honeſt force to unlooſe her
ſelfe from them. But he ſayd unto her, no (ſweet Miſtreſſe) it
muſt not bee ſo; it is not meet that you ſhould ſtrive to get your
ſelfe forth from forth his armes, who holds you alreadie fo faſt in his
ſoule. With theſe kinde words <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadia</hi> came wholy to her ſelfe,
and perfectly recovered her loſt ſences; and <hi>Dona Eſtefania</hi> made
an end of going any further forward with her former determination; ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to the Prieſt, that he ſhould forthwith without any further delay
eſpouſe her Sonne to <hi>Leocadia.</hi> He did ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was
no difficultie that interpoſed it ſelfe for the hindering of theſe
Eſpouſalls.</p>
            <p>Which being now fully ended and finiſhed, I leave it to ſome
choycer Pen, and to ſome other wit more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined then mine; to recount the
generall joy and gladnes of all thoſe that were there preſent; the
embracements which <hi>Leocadia's</hi> Parents gave <hi>Rodolfo,</hi> the
thankes which they gave to Heaven, and to his Parents; the fayre of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of
love and friendſhippe on their parts; the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and wonder of
<hi>Rodolfo's</hi> Comrades, who ſo unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly ſaw the very ſelfe
ſame night of their arrivall there, ſo ſayre a match made up. And they
wondered the more when they knew by <hi>Dona Eſtefania's</hi> diſcourſe
before<pb n="207" facs="tcp:58406:107"/>them all that <hi>Leocadia</hi> was the Damoſell
which in their company her Sonne had violently ſtollen and carried away.</p>
            <p>Nor did <hi>Rodolfo</hi> remaine any whit leſſe
ſuſpenſefull; and for the better certifying himſelfe of this truth, hee
entreated <hi>Leocadia</hi> that ſhee would acquaint him with ſome ſigne
or token, whereby hee might come to the full knowledge of that which hee did
not doubt of, becauſe his Parents had ſo well approved his match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with
her, whereunto ſhe made this anſwer. When I returned and came to my ſelfe
from out another ſwounding, I round my ſelfe (deare Sir) in your armes
without mine honour; but I thinke it now well employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſince that in this
my latter comming to my ſelfe, I finde my ſelfe in the ſame armes I did
then, but with much more honour. And if this token be not ſufficient, let
that ſuffice of the Image of a <hi>Crucifix,</hi> which none could ſteale
from you but my ſelfe, which you could not chuſe but miſſe the next
morning. And if that bee the very ſame which your Mother hath now in her
keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you are the Image of my ſoule which I highly adore, and you ſhall
bee ſtill neereſt and deareſt unto mee as long (my deare) as God ſhall
permit us to live together. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon hee embracing her a new, their Parents
beſtowed their benedictions upon them, and all the reſt that were by, bid
God give them joy.</p>
            <p>Supper came in, and the Muſitians were come, which were before
hand provided for this purpoſe. <hi>Rodolfo</hi> beheld himſelfe in the
looking-glaſſe of his Sonnes face. The Grandfathers and Grandmothers on
both ſides, wept for very joy; nor was there any corner in all the whole
houſe which was not viſited with a <hi>Iubilee,</hi> with exceeding great
content and gladneſſe. And although night did flie away with it's blacke
nimble wings; yet it ſeemed to <hi>Rodolfo,</hi> that it did goe and walke,
not with wings, but with crut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; ſo great was the deſire which he had to
ſee himſelfe<pb n="208" facs="tcp:58406:108"/>all alone with his beloved Spouſe; at
laſt came that deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red houre. They all of them went to bed to take their
reſt, and the whole houſe remained buried in ſilence. But ſo cannot the
truth of this ſtorie, by reaſon that the many Children will not give way
thereunto, and that noble off-ſpring which they have remaining in
<hi>Toledo.</hi> And yet theſe happie couple are ſtill living, and long may
they live, to the joy and comfort of themſelves, their Children, and
Grandchildren. All which was brought to paſſe by the permiſſion of
Heaven, and by the force of that bloud, which the valiant, noble, and
Chriſtian Grandfather of <hi>Luiſico,</hi> ſaw ſpilt upon the
ground.</p>

kept her very ſecret and cloſe in his owne Ship, ſtanding wonderfully
affectioned, though very Chriſtianly, to the incomparable beauty of
<hi>Iſabelld,</hi> for ſo was the Childe called.</p>
            <p>In concluſion, her Parents remained without her very ſad and

            <p>
               <hi>Clotaldo</hi> had a Some named <hi>Ricaredo,</hi> about ſome

forgetting thoſe cockerings of her true Parents; but not ſo much that ſhe
did ceaſe to thinke on them, and to ſigh often for them. And although ſhe
went learning the tongue of the Iſland, yet did ſhee not loſe her
Spaniſh. For <hi>Clotaldo</hi> tooke care to bring <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyards</hi>

workes, which a well bred Damoſell could, or ought to learne, they taught her
to read and to write more then indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently well. But that wherein ſhee did
excell, was in playing upon all thoſe Inſtruments of Muſicke, which might
with moſt decencie become a woman; accompanying the ſame with ſuch a
voyce which Heaven had beſtowed on her in ſo rare and ſingular a kinde,
that when ſhe chaunted, ſhe inchaunted all that heard her.</p>
            <p>All theſe her acquired graces, beſides thoſe that were
na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall unto her, went by little and little, kindling the coals of love in
<hi>Ricaredo's</hi> heart; to whom as to her Maſters Son, ſhe wiſhed all
good and happineſſe, and carried her ſelfe towards him with all faire

            <p>At firſt love led him or with onely a kinde of liking and

in conſidering her infinite vertues and graces, and loving her as if ſhee
had beene his Siſter, his deſires not going beyond their honeſt and
vertuous bounds. But when as <hi>Iſabella</hi> began to grow towards woman,
(for then when <hi>Ricaredo</hi> burned in the flames of love ſhee was twelve
yeares of age) that his former good will, and that complacencie and liking, was
tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into moſt fervent deſires of enjoying and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her,
not that hee did aſpire thereunto by any other meanes, then by thoſe of
being her Husband; ſince that from the incomparable beautie of
<hi>Iſabel</hi> (for ſo did they call her) no other thing could be hoped
for, neither would hee himſelfe, though hee could have expected that favour
from her; becauſe his noble condition, and the high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme wherein hee

            <p>A thouſand times did hee determine with himſelfe to manifeſt
the love he bare her to his Parents; and againe<pb n="212" facs="tcp:58406:110"/>at oft did

dedicated him for to bee the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of a very rich and principall
Gentlewoman, a Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Damoſell, who was likewiſe (like them) a cloſe
and concealed Chriſtian. And it was cleare and apparant, (as he conceived,
and ſaid with himſelfe) that they would not bee willing to give unto a
flave (if this name may bee given to <hi>Iſabella</hi>) that which they had
treated, and in a manner concluded on to give to a gentlewoman. And therefore
being much perplexed and penſive, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what courſe to take for to
attaine to the end of his good deſire; he paſſed over ſuch a kinde of
life as had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt brought him to the point of loſing it. But it ſeeming
unto him to bee great cowardize and faint-heartedneſſe, to ſuffer
himſelfe to dye without ſeeking out ſome kinde of remedie for his griefe;
he did hearten and incourage himſelfe to open his minde, and declare his
intent to <hi>Iſabella.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All they of the houſe were very ſad and heavie, and much
troubled by reaſon of <hi>Ricaredo</hi> his ſickneſſe. (for hee was
well beloved of them all,) but his Father and Mother exceeding ſorrowfull, as
well for that they had no other Childe, as alſo for that his great vertue,
valour, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding did deſerve it. The Phiſitians did not hit
right up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his diſeaſe, neither durſt he, neither would he diſcover it
unto them. In the end, being fully reſolved to breake through theſe
difficulties which hee imagined with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; one day amongſt the reſt,
that <hi>Iſabella</hi> came in to ſerve and attend him, ſeeing her all
alone, with a low voyce, and a troubled tongue, he ſpake unto her after this
manner.</p>
            <p>Faire <hi>Iſabella,</hi> thy much worth, thy great vertue, and
exceeding beautie, not to be equalled by any; have brought me to that
exteamitie wherein you ſee me; and therefore if you will that I ſhould
leave my life in the hands of the greateſt extreamitie that may bee imagined;
let thy good<pb n="213" facs="tcp:58406:110"/>deſire be anſwerable unto mine, which is
no other then to receive thee for my Spouſe. But this muſt bee carried
cloſely, and kept hid from my Parents, of whom I am afraid (who becauſe
they know that which I know, thy great deſervingneſſe) that they will
denie mee that good which doth ſo much concerne mee. If thou wilt give me thy
word to bee mine, I ſhall forthwith paſſe mine, as a true Chriſtian to
be thine. And put caſe that I ſhould never come to enjoy thee, as I will
not till that I have the Churches benediction, and my Parents good will, yet
with this my imagining, that thou wilt be aſſuredly mine, it will be
ſufficient to recover me my health, and to make me live merrily and
contented, till that happie and deſired time ſhall come.</p>
            <p>Whileſt that <hi>Ricaredo</hi> diſcourſed thus with her,
<hi>Iſabella</hi> ſtood hearkening unto him with downe caſt eyes,
ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that her modeſt and ſober looke, that her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie did
equall her beautie, and her circumſpection, her great diſcretion. And
ſeeing that <hi>Ricaredo</hi> had made an end of ſpeaking, and was
ſilent; this honeſt, faire, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Damoſell made him this
anſwer.</p>
            <p>Since that the rigour or clemency of Heaven (for I know not to
which of theſe extreames I may attribute it) would <hi>(Signior
Ricaredo)</hi> quit me of my Parents, and give me unto yours, (thankefully
acknowledging the infinite favours they have done me.) I reſolved with my
ſelfe, that my will ſhould never be any other then theirs; and therefore
without it, the ineſtimable grace and favour which you are willing to doe
mee, I ſhould not hold it a happineſſe, but a miſerie, not a good, but
a bad fortune. But if they being made acquainted therewith, I might bee ſo
happie as to deſerve you, from this day forward I offer unto you that will
and conſent which they ſhall give mee. And in the meane while that this
ſhall be or deferred, or not at all effected; let your deſires entertaine
themſelves with this, that mine ſhall bee eternall, and pure, in wiſhing
you all<pb n="214" facs="tcp:58406:111"/>that good which Heaven can give you.</p>
            <p>Here did <hi>Iſabella</hi> put a period to her honeſt and
diſcreet words, and there began <hi>Ricaredo's</hi> recoverie. And now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to bee revived thoſe hopes of his Parents, which in this his ſickneſſe
were almoſt quite dead.</p>
            <p>Theſe two modeſt Lovers with a gseat deale of courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and
kindneſſe tooke leave each of other; he with tears in his eyes, ſhee with
admiration in her ſoule, to ſee that <hi>Ricaredo</hi> ſhould render up
his love, to hers. Who being rayſed from his bed (to his Parents ſeeming)
by miracle; hee would not now any longer conceale his thoughts, and therefore
one day he manifeſted them to his Mother, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her in the end of his
diſcourſe, that if they did not Marrie him to <hi>Iſabella,</hi> that to
denie him her, and give him his death, it was one and the ſame thing. With
ſuch words, and with ſuch endearings <hi>Ricaredo</hi> did extoll to the
Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens the vertues of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> that it ſeemed to his Mother,
that <hi>Iſabella</hi> had not wrought upon her Son to win him to be her
Husband. She did put her Son in good hope ſo to diſpoſe his Father, that
he might like as well thereof, as ſhe did. And it ſo fell out, that
repeating to her Husband word by word, what her Son had ſayd unto her, he was
eaſily moved to give way to that which his Son ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſired,
framing excuſes to hinder that Marriage, which was in a manner agreed upon
for the Northern Damoſell.</p>
            <p>When this was in agitation, <hi>Iſabella</hi> was 14. yeares of
age, and <hi>Ricaredo</hi> 20. And in theſe their ſo green and
flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing years, their great diſcretion and knowne prudence, made them
ancient.</p>
            <p>There were but foure dayes wanting to come, which being
accompliſhed, <hi>Ricaredo</hi> his Parents were willing that their Sonne
ſhould enter into the ſtate of Matrimonie, holding themſelves both
wiſe, and happie, in having cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen their priſoner to be their Daughter,
eſteeming more the do wrie of her vertues, then the great ſtore of wealth
that<pb n="215" facs="tcp:58406:111"/>was offered with the Northerne Damoſell.</p>
            <p>The wedding clothes were already made, their kinsfolk and friends
invited thereunto; and there was no other thing wanting, ſave making the
Queene acquainted with Marriage, becauſe without her good will and conſent,
the amongſt thoſe of noble bloud, not any Marriage is effected; but they
doubted not of her good leave, and licence, and therefore had ſo long
deferred the craving of it.</p>
            <p>I ſay then, that all things ſtanding in this eſtate, when
there wanted but foure dayes till that of the wedding, one evening gave
diſturbance to all this their joy. A ſervant of the Queenes came and
brought a meſſage to <hi>Clotaldo,</hi> with expreſſe command from her
Majeſtie, that the next morning he ſhould bring to her Preſence his
Spaniſh Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that he brought from <hi>Cadiz. Clotaldo</hi> returned
anſwer, that her Majeſties pleaſure ſhould moſt willingly bee
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed. The Gentleman having delivered his meſſage, and received his
anſwer, went his way, leaving the hearts of all the whole houſe full of
paſſion, perturbations, and feares.</p>
            <p>Aye me (ſayd the Ladie <hi>Catalina</hi>) if it bee come to the
Queenes knowledge that I have bred up this Childe in the Chriſtian religion;
and ſhall from thence inferre that all we of this Familie are Chriſtians.
Beſides, if the Queene ſhall aske her what ſhe hath learned in eight
yeares ſince that ſhe was our priſoner; what can the poore harmleſſe
ſoule anſwer, which ſhall not (notwithſtanding all her diſcretion)
condemne us?</p>
            <p>Which <hi>Iſabella</hi> hearing, ſpake thus unto her.</p>
            <p>Let not (deare Ladie) this feare give you any trouble at all; for
my truſt is in God that he will put words into my mouth at that inſtant,
out of his Divine Mercie towards me; that ſhall not onely not condemne you,
but that ſhall much redound to your good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ricaredo</hi> was much ſtartled therewith, as divining
ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſome ill ſucceſſe. <hi>Clotaldo</hi> ſought out meanes that
might<pb n="216" facs="tcp:58406:112"/>give ſome courage to his great feare, but found
none, ſave in the great conſidence which he had in God, and in the
wiſedome of <hi>Iſabella;</hi> who earneſtly entreated her, that by all
the wayes ſhe poſſibly could deviſe, ſhe ſhould excuſe her
condemning of them to be Chriſtians; for though in ſpirit they were readie
to receive Martyrdome; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, the fleſh was weake, and were
loth to drinke of that bitter cup.</p>
            <p>Not once, but often <hi>Iſabella</hi> aſſured them to reſt
aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that for her cauſe, or any default of hers, that ſhould not
ſucceed which they feared and ſuſpected. For albeit ſhe then knew not
what anſwer to make to thoſe Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatories and queſtions, which in
ſuch a caſe as this might be put unto her; yet had ſhe ſuch a lively
and aſſured hope that ſhe ſhould anſwer thereunto in ſuch ſort
(as ſhe had at other times told them) that her anſwers ſhould rather doe
them good then hurt.</p>
            <p>They diſcourſed that night on many things, eſpecially on
this particular; that if the Queene had knowne that they were Chriſtians,
ſhee would not have ſent them ſo milde a meſſage; whence they might
inferre, that ſhee was onely deſirous to ſee <hi>Iſabella,</hi> whoſe
unequalled beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and abilitie had come to her cares, and to thoſe of the
Court, as it did to all thoſe of the Citie. But becauſe they had not before
this preſented her unto her Majeſtie, they found themſelves faulty; of
which fault, they thought good to excuſe themſelves, by ſaying; that from
that very inſtant that ſhe came into his power, he had made choice of her,
and as it were marked her out for to be the wife of of his Sonne
<hi>Ricaredo.</hi> But in this too, they likewiſe found themſelves faultie,
for having made ſuch a match without her Majeſties leave, and licence;
howbeit this fault did not ſeeme unto them worthy of any great puniſhment.
With this they comforted themſelves, and agreed amongſt themſelves by a
joynt conſent, that <hi>Iſabella</hi> ſhould not goe meanely clad to
Court, but like a Bride, ſince that ſhee<pb n="217" facs="tcp:58406:112"/>was the
Spouſe of his Sonne <hi>Ricaredo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being thus reſolved, the next day they apparrelled
<hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi> after the Spaniſh faſhion; in a gowne of green Sattin
cut upon cloth of gold, embroydered with Eſſes of pearles, wearing a great
chaine of moſt rich orient pearles about her necke, having a hatband of
Diamonds, and a Fanne in her hand, after the manner of your Spaniſh Ladies.
Her haires of her head, which were full and long, and of a bright pleaſing
colour, ſowen, and interwoven with Diamonds and Pearles, did ſerve her
inſtead of a coyfe. With this moſt rich dreſſing and lively
diſpoſition, and admirable beautie, She ſhewed her ſelfe that day in
<hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolin,</hi> riding in a faire Caroch, carrying along with her, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by ſo beautifull a ſight, the ſoules and eyes of as many as looked on
her. There were with her in the ſame Caroch, <hi>Clotaldo</hi> and his wife,
and <hi>Ricaredo,</hi> and on horſe back many noble gentlemen of their
kindred, and Alliance. All this honour <hi>Clotaldo</hi> was willing to do his
Priſoner, for to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liege the Queene to uſe her as the Spouſe of his
Son.</p>
            <p>Being come now to the Court, and brought into the Chamber of
Preſence where the Queene was, <hi>Iſabella</hi> ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thereinto;
preſenting there the fayreſt ſhow which can fall within the compaſſe
of imagination. The roome was large and ſpacious, and the traine that came
with her had not gone above two ſteps forward, but they ſtood ſtil; and
<hi>Iſabella</hi> alone by her ſelfe, advanced her ſelfe towards the
State where the Queene ſate; and being thus alone, ſhe ſeemed to appeare
juſt like that ſtarre, or exhalation, which by the region of fire is wont
to move it ſelfe in a cleare and quiet night; or like unto a ray, or beame of
the Sunne; which at the opening of the day diſcovers it ſelfe betweene two
mountaines. All this did ſhe ſeeme to bee, or rather like a Commet which
did prognoſticate the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming and ſetting on fire many of thoſe
ſoules that were preſent, which love had throughly heated, if not burned
with the rayes of thoſe reſplendant ſunnes of beautifull 
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:58406:113"/>
               <hi>Iſabella,</hi> who full of humilitie, and
courteſie, made her approaches by degrees, addreſſing her ſelf to
kneele down before the Queene, and then after a ſhort pauſing ſaid thus
unto her. May it pleaſe your moſt excellent Majeſtie, ſo far forth to
honour this your ſervant, that ſhe may kiſſe your royall hand; ſo
ſhall I ever hereafter hold my ſelfe to be a Ladie, ſince that I have
beene ſo happie, as to come to ſee your greatneſſe.</p>
            <p>The Queene continued looking upon her a good while, without
ſpeaking one word; it ſeeming unto her (as ſhe afterwards told a great
Ladie of her Bed chamber) that ſhee had a ſtarrified heaven before her;
whoſe ſtarres were thoſe many Pearles, and Diamonds which
<hi>Iſabella</hi> bare about her. Her fayre face, and eyes were the Sunne and
Moone; and take all together in the whole peece, ſhee was a new wonder of
beautie. The Ladies that attended about the Queens Perſon, wiſhed that they
had beene all eyes, that there might not remaine any thing in, or about
<hi>Iſabella,</hi> which they might not behold and view at full. Some
commended the quickneſſe of her eyes, ſome the colour of her face, and
pureneſſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion; ſome the properneſſe of her body, and
ſome the ſweetnes of her ſpeech. And ſome likewiſe, who out of meere
envie, ſaid; the <hi>Spaniard</hi> is a very handſome gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, but her
habite and dreſſing ſeemeth very ſtrange, and out of faſhion. After
ſome little ſuſpenſion, the Queene cauſing <hi>Iſabella</hi> to
riſe up, ſhe ſaid unto her; ſpeake (pretty Mayd) unto mee in Spaniſh,
for I underſtand it well, and ſhall take much pleaſure therein. And
turning her ſelfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Clotaldo,</hi> ſhe ſayd unto him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clotaldo,</hi> you have done Vs wrong, in keeping this
trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſo long concealed from Vs; but it is ſuch, and ſo rich, that
it hath moved you to covetouſneſſe; you are bound to reſtore it unto
Vs, for by right it is Ours, and properly belongeth unto Vs.</p>
            <p>Madam (anſwered <hi>Clotaldo</hi>) it is true which your 
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:58406:113"/>Majeſtie ſayth; I confeſſe my fault, if it bee a
fault to have kept this treaſure, that it might be preſerved in that
perfection, as was fitting to appeare in your Majeſties Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. And now
that it is here before your eye, I thought to have much improved it, by craving
your Majeſties leave that <hi>Iſabella</hi> might be the Spouſe of my
Sonne <hi>Ricaredo,</hi> and to give your moſt excellent Majeſtie in
theſe two, all that I am able to give you.</p>
            <p>Her very name gives Vs very good content (replied the Queene)
there could nothing have beene more wanting ſave the name of
<hi>Iſabella</hi> the <hi>Spanyard,</hi> to take off ſomething from that
perfection which is in her. But how is it <hi>(Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taldo)</hi> that without Our
leave you have promiſed her to your Sonne?</p>
            <p>It is true Madam (anſwered <hi>Clotaldo</hi>) I have made him a
promiſe of her, but it was upon the confidence that the many and notable
ſervices which my ſelfe, and my Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtours have done this Crowne, might
obtaine of your Majeſtie other more difficult favours, then this of your
leave; and the rather, for that my Sonne is not yet eſpouſed unto her.</p>
            <p>Neither ſhall he (ſayd the Queene) Marry <hi>Iſabella,</hi>
till he by himſelfe, and in his owne perſon ſhall deſerve her. Our
meaning is, that I will not that either your owne or your Aunceſtors
ſervices, ſhall any whit benefit him him in this particular; but that hee
in his owne perſon ſhall diſpoſe himſelfe to ſerve mee, and for to
merit for himſelfe, and by his owne proweſſe, this ſweet pledge, whom
we e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme and reckon of as if ſhe were our owne Daughter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iſabella</hi> had ſcarce heard this laſt word delivered,
when humbling her ſelfe againe on her knees before the Queene, ſhee ſpake
unto her in the Spaniſh tongue, to this effect.</p>
            <p>As graces, which brings ſuch graces with them (moſt noble
Queene) are rather to be accounted happineſſe, then misfortunes. And
ſince that your Majeſtie hath beene pleaſed to grace me with the name of
Daughter upon ſo<pb n="220" facs="tcp:58406:114"/>good a pledge, what ill can I feare? or
what good may I not hope for?</p>
            <p>Looke what <hi>Iſabella</hi> uttered, came from her ſo
gracefully, and ſo wittingly, that the Queen ſtood extreamely affected
towards her; and commanded that ſhee ſhould remaine at Court in her
ſervice; and recommended her to a great Ladie, the chiefeſt amongſt
thoſe of her Bed-chamber, that ſhee might trayne her up according to the
Court faſhion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ricaredo,</hi> who ſaw that his life was taken away, in
taking away <hi>Iſabella,</hi> was readie almoſt to have loſt his wits;
and therefore though overtaken with a tumbling and ſudden paſſion of
heart, he went and fell upon his knees before the Queen, and ſayd unto
her.</p>
            <p>That I may ſerve your Majeſtie, I need not to be incited
thereunto by any other rewards, then by thoſe which my fore-fathers, and
Aunceſtours have gotten by ſerving their Kings. But ſince that it is your
Maieſties pleaſure that I ſhould ſerve you with good deſires, and
pretenſions; I would gladly know, in what kinde, and in what employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I
may manifeſt that; I cumply with that obligation which I owe unto your
Maieſtie, and put my ſelfe to that which you ſhall impoſe upon me.</p>
            <p>I have two Ships royall (anſwered the Queene) ready to put forth
to Sea, whereof I have made Generall the <hi>Baron</hi> of <hi>Lunſac,</hi>
of one of theſe I make you Captaine, him Admirall, and you Vice-Admirall. For
the bloud from whence you come, and runneth in your veines, doth aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
mee that you will ſupply the defect of your yeares; and conſider well the
favour which wee doe you, ſince that therein I give you occaſion, that
correſponding with that which you are, and doing things anſwerable to the
race from whence you come; by ſerving your Queene, you may ſhow the worth
of your noble diſpoſition, and ohyour perſon, and you ſhall receive
there by the greateſt reverd, which in your opinion you can wiſh or
deſire.<pb n="221" facs="tcp:58406:114"/>I my ſelfe will be <hi>Iſabella's</hi>
Guard, though ſhe give Vs ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt tokens, that her owne honeſtie will
be her ſafeſt and ſureſt guard. God bleſſe you in your Voyage; and
ſince that you goe hence deepely (as I imagine) in love, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe great
matters unto my ſelfe of your noble exploitd. Happy ſhall that King that
goes to warre bee, who ſhall have in his Armie ten thouſand Souldiers that
are in love, for they will live in hope that the reward of their victories,
ſhall be the enioying of their beſt beloved. Riſe up <hi>Rica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redo,</hi>
and bethinke your ſelfe if you will or have any thing to ſay to
<hi>Iſabella,</hi> for to morrow you muſt begon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ricaredo</hi> kiſſed the Queenes hand, humbly thanking
her, and highly eſteeming the favour which ſhe did him, and preſently
went from her to <hi>Iſabella,</hi> and would feigne have ſpoken unto her,
but could not, for love and grief had knit ſuch a knot in his throat, and
ſo tied his tongue, that had his life layen upon it, hee could not utter one
word. But the water ſtood in his eies, and were ſo brimme-full, that they
ranne over, and ſilently trickled downe his cheekes which he thought to
diſſemble and ſmother them, all that hee poſſibly could; yet
notwithſtanding could hee not hide them from the eyes of the Queene, and
therefore ſhe ſaid unto him.</p>
            <p>Thinke it no ſhame <hi>Ricaredo</hi> to weepe, neither valew
your ſelfe the leſſe, for having given at this your farewell ſuch
tender demonſtrations of your heart. For it is one thing to fight with your
enemies, and another thing to take your leave of her you love.
<hi>Iſabella,</hi> embrace <hi>Ricaredo,</hi> and give him your benediction,
for his exceſſive ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and loathneſſe to leave you, doth very
well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iſabella,</hi> who ſtood amazed and aſtoniſhed to
ſee <hi>Rica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redo's</hi> tender heartedneſſe, and how truely he did
grieve, and all for her ſake, whom ſhe loved as her Husband; did not
underſtand what the Queene had commanded her, but began to ſhed teares;
ſo without thinking what<pb n="222" facs="tcp:58406:115"/>ſhe did, and ſtood ſo
ſtill, and without any motion, that it ſeemed not to be a living ſoule,
but a <hi>Statua</hi> of <hi>Alablaſter</hi> that wept.</p>
            <p>The affections of theſe two true and tender lovers, made the
ſtanders by to melt likewiſe into teares. And ſo <hi>Rica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redo</hi>
without ſpeaking a word to <hi>Iſabella,</hi> or <hi>Iſabella</hi> to
him, they turned each from other, and <hi>Clotaldo,</hi> and they that came
with him, doing reverence to the Queene, went out of the Preſence full of
compaſſion, diſcontent, and teares.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iſabella</hi> now remained like a poore Orphanee, comming
from the Buriall of her Father and Mother, and as full now of feare, as before
of griefe; leaſt that her new Ladie to whom ſhee was recommended, would
make her to change thoſe manners and cuſtomes wherein ſhe had been
formerly bred up.</p>
            <p>In concluſion, there ſhee remained, and within two daies after
<hi>Ricaredo</hi> hoyſed ſayle, and put forth to Sea, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten amongſt
many other with this thought, that he muſt do ſome notable peece of
ſervice, that might intitle him <hi>the deſerver of Iſabella.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in concluſion, he beſought Heaven to be propitious unto
him, that ſuch occaſions might be offered unto him; wherein by ſhewing
himſelfe valiant, hee might cumply with the dutie of a Chriſtian, leaving
the Queene ſatisfied, and <hi>Iſabella</hi> deſorved.</p>
            <p>Sixe daies theſe two Shippes ſailed with a proſperous winde,
ſhaping their courſe for the <hi>Tercera</hi> Iſlands; a place where
never are wanting, either Ships of <hi>Portugal,</hi> from the
<hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> or ſome that come thither from the
<hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> And at ſixe daies end there aroſe ſuch a
croſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winde full in the teeth of them, and continued ſo long and ſo
ſtrong, that without ſuffering them to reach the Iſlands, they were
inforced to make for <hi>Spaine;</hi> neere unto whoſe Coaſt, at the mouth
of the Sneight of <hi>Gibratar,</hi> they deſerie three Ships; the one a very
tall and goodly Ship, and the other two much leſſe.<pb n="223" facs="tcp:58406:115"/>
               <hi>Ricaredo's</hi> Ship made up to that which was Admirall, for to
know of his Generall, whether or no he would ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe three Ships
which they had deſcried. But before that he came up unto them; he might
diſcerne that upon the toppe of the maine maſt, there was hung out a blacke
ſtreamer, and comming a little neerer, he might heareFifes, and Trumpets
ſounding faintly, and hoarſely; cleare and apparant ſignes that the
Generall was dead, or ſome other principall perſon of the Shippe. At laſt
comming within hearing, that they might ſpeake one to another, which they had
not done ſince their firſt putting forth; they might heare them from out
the Admirall call out aloud un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, to have the Vice-Admirall
<hi>Ricaredo</hi> to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord their Ship, becauſe the Generall the night
before died of an Appoplexie.</p>
            <p>All upon this newes were very ſad, ſave <hi>Ricaredo,,</hi>
who was inwardly glad, not for the loſſe of his Generall, but to ſee that
hee was left at libertie, and might freely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand both Shippes; for ſo was
it ordered by the Queene, that the Generall miscarrying, <hi>Ricaredo</hi>
ſhould ſucceed in his roome. Who preſently went aboord the Admirall,
where he found ſome that mourn'd for their dead General, and others that
rejoyced with him that was now living. In a word, both the one and the other
preſently yeelded him obedience, and with ſhort ceremonies cry'd him up for
their Generall; two of thoſe three Shippes which they had diſcovered not
giving leave for greater, which going aloofe from the great Shippe, made up to
the two Ships. They ſtreight knew them to be Gallies, and Turkiſh Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
by the halfe Moones which they bare in their flagges, which gave
<hi>Ricaredo</hi> great contentment; it ſeeming unto him, that that prize if
Heaven ſhould grant it him, would be of great benefit.</p>
            <p>The Turkiſh Gallies came to know the Northern ſhips, who did
not carry the Armes of the Iſland in their flagges, but of <hi>Spaine,</hi>
for to deceive thoſe that ſhould chance to<pb n="224" facs="tcp:58406:116"/>deſcrie
them, and might take them to be Shippes of Pira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. The <hi>Turkes</hi>
thought they had beene Shippes that had come from the <hi>Indies,</hi> waſted
and ſpent with their long voyage, and that they would quickly yeeld and be
taken. Wherupon, they came incroaching by little and little upon them, thinking
preſently to boord them, and <hi>Ricaredo</hi> ſuffered them to come neerer
and neerer unto him, till he had them in command of his Ordnance, and then let
flie at them, and giving them a broad ſide, diſcharged ſo luc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kily, and
with ſuch furie, that he ſhot one of the Gallies thorow, and thorow; ſo
that one halfe of it lay all open, and naked, which forced them to flie, and
make the beſt ſhift they could for to eſcape boording. The other Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
ſeeing it's fellowes ill ſucceſſe, made away in all haſte, and
ſtrove to put her ſelfe under the ſide of the great Ship. But
<hi>Ricaredo,</hi> who had Shippes that were light laden, and were quicke and
nimble; and ſuch excellent ſaylers, that they would turne and winde, and
come off and on, as if they had beene plied with Oares; commanded them to
charge the Ordnance anew, chaſing them even to the ſhip, ſhowring upon
them a world of ſhot. They of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened Gallie, as ſoone as they came to
the ſhip, forſooke their Galley, and with all poſſible haſte
endeavoured to get into the ſhip. Which being perceived by <hi>Ricaredo,</hi>
and that the ſound Gallie imyloyed it ſelfe in relieving the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; he
ſets upon her with both his ſhips, and without giving her leave to ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ke about, or to make any uſe of her
Oares, he did put her to that ſtreight and exigent, that the <hi>Turkes</hi>
likewiſe that were in her, were forced to flee for refuge to the ſhip, not
with any hope to defend themſelves therein, or to ſtand it out in fight,
but for to eſcape for the preſent with their lives. The
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> wherwith thoſe Gallies were man'd, tearing up their
bankes, and breaking their chaines, intermingled with the <hi>Turkes,</hi>
ſought to recover their ſhip; and as they were clambring up by the ſide
of her, with musket ſhot from the ſhips, they went<pb n="225" facs="tcp:58406:116"/>ſhooting at them, as at a marke; but <hi>Ricaredo</hi> gave order
that they ſhould ſhoot onely at the <hi>Turkes,</hi> and ſpare the
Chriſtians. Thus were all the <hi>Turkes</hi> almoſt ſlaine; and they who
entered the ſhippe with the Chriſtians, for they were mingled one amongſt
another, making uſe of their weapons, were cut in peeces. For the force of
the valiant when they begin to fall, muſt yeeld to the weakeneſſe of
thoſe that are riſing. And therefore the Chriſtians take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart, layed
about them with ſuch courage and mettle, that they did wonders for the
working of their libertie; thinking all this while that thoſe Northerne
ſhips where <hi>Spaniſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In concluſion, the chriſtians having in a manner cut all the
<hi>Turkes</hi> throates, ſome <hi>Spanyards</hi> ſhewed themſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Decke, and called out a loud unto thoſe whom they ſuppoſed to bee
<hi>Spanyards;</hi> that they would come aboord them, and enjoy the reward of
their victorie. <hi>Ricaredo</hi> asked them in <hi>Spaniſh</hi> what
ſhippe that was? they told him that ſhee was a <hi>Portugal</hi> come from
the <hi>Haſt-Indies</hi> laden with ſpices, and as many Pearles, and
Diamonds, as were worth a Million, and that by a ſtorme they were driven upon
that Coaſt, all rent and torne, and without any Ordnance, for the
fouleneſſe of the weather, and high working of the Sea, inforced them to
throw it over-boord. That their men were moſt of them ſicke, and almoſt
dead of thirſt, and hunger; and that thoſe two Gallies which were belonging
to the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <hi>Arpantemuam</hi> had taken her but the day before, without
making any defence at all. And that (as it was told them) becauſe they were
not able to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſo great a quantitie of riches in thoſe two ſmall
Veſſells; they towed her along, with purpoſe to put her into the River of
<hi>Larache,</hi> which was neere there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ricaredo</hi> returned them anſwere, that if they conceived
that thoſe his two Shippes were <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> they were 
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:58406:117"/>deceived, for they were nothing leſſe, but ſhips
belonging to the Queene of the Northern Iſland. Which newes gave thoſe that
heard it, occaſion of feare, and ſorrow; i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magining (and not without
reaſon,) that they were fallen out of one net into another. But
<hi>Ricaredo</hi> told them that they ſhould receive no harme, and that they
ſhould reſt aſſured of their libertie, on condition that they ſhould
not put themſelves upon their defence. Nor is it poſſible for us (replied
they) ſo to doe; for (as wee formerly told you) this Shippe hath no Ordnance,
nor wee any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive Armes; and therefore wee muſt of force whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee
will or no, have recourſe to the gentile and noble diſpoſition of your
Generall, and the liberalitie and courteſie which hee ſhall uſe towards
us; ſince that it is meet and juſt that hee who hath freed us from the
inſufferable captivitie of the <hi>Turkes,</hi> ſhould reape the reward and
benefit thereof, and ſhall bee famouſed of all thoſe to whoſe eares the
newes ſhall come, of this memorable victorie, and of his kinde uſage
towardes them.</p>
            <p>Theſe words of the <hi>Spanyard</hi> did not ſound ill in
<hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caredo's</hi> cares; and therefore calling thoſe of his ſhippe to a
councell, hee demanded of them how hee might ſend all the Chriſtians to
<hi>Spaine,</hi> without putting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in danger of any ſiniſter
ſucceſſe; if being ſo many as they were, they ſhould take courage
unto them for to riſe up againſt them? Some were of opinion, that hee
ſhould paſſe them one by one to his owne Shippe, and clapping them under
hatches, kill them man after man; and ſo they might eaſily and without any
noyſe kill them all, and carry the great Shippe along with them to
<hi>Mundolin</hi> without any further feare or care taking. But to this
<hi>Ricaredo</hi> thus replied.</p>
            <p>Since that God hath done us this ſo great a favour, in giving us
ſuch great riches, I will not requite<pb n="227" facs="tcp:58406:117"/>him with a cruell
and unthankefull minde; nor is it meete that that which I may remedie by
induſtry, I ſhould reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die it by the ſword. And therefore, I for my part
am of opinion, that no Chriſtian ſhould dye the death. Not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I
wiſh them ſo well, but becauſe I wiſh well to my ſelfe, and would
that this dayes noble action, neither to me, nor to you, ſhould mingle the
name of valiant, with the ſir-name of cruell; for crueltie did never ſort
well with valour. That which is to bee done, is this; that all the Ordnance of
one of theſe our Shippes, be put into the great <hi>Portugal</hi> Ship,
without leaving the Ship any Armes, or any other thing, ſave ſufficient
victuall. And ſo man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that Ship with our men, we will carry it home, and
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> goe in the other to <hi>Spaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>None durſt contradict that which <hi>Ricaredo</hi> had
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and ſome held him to bee valiant, magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and of good
underſtanding and judgement; and others in their hearts, to be more courteous
then he ought to have beene,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ricaredo</hi> then having reſolved on this courſe, he put
50 Muskatiers into the <hi>Portugal</hi> Ship all readie fitted and
furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, their Peeces charged with ſhot, and their matches burning in
their cockes. He found in the Ship well neere 300. perſons, with thoſe that
had eſcaped out of the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. He preſently called for their Cocket, or
bill of lading; and the ſame perſon who at firſt ſpake to him from the
Docke made him anſwer; that the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Pirate had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie taken
their Cocket from them, and that it was drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with him. Hee did inſtantly
put his pully in order, and bringing his leſſer veſſell and laſhing
it cloſe to the ſide of the great Ship with wonderfull celeritie, and with
the helpe of ſtrong ropes, they hoyſed all their Ordnance with their
Carriages, out of the leſſer into the greater Ship.</p>
            <p>This being done, hee forthwith made a ſhort ſpeech to the
Chriſtians; he commanded them to goe into the Ship<pb n="228" facs="tcp:58406:118"/>that
was now diſincun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ted, where they
ſhould finde good ſtore of victuall for more then a moneth, and more
mouthes then they had. And as they went Imbarquing themſelves, he gave to
every one of them foure <hi>Spaniſh Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolets,</hi> which becauſed to be
brolight from his owne Ship, for to relieve in part their neceſſitie when
they came on land; which was ſo neere, that from thence they might kenne the

               </gap> mountains of <hi>Anila,</hi>
and <hi>Calpe.</hi> All of them gave him infinite thankes for the favour he had
done them; and the laſt that went to embarque himſelfe, was he who had
beene the mouth of the reſt, who ſaid unto <hi>Ricaredo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moſt valiant ſir, I ſhould hold it a happines for me,
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt theſe my misfortunes, and the greater of the two; that you would
rather carry me along with you to <hi>Munaolin,</hi> then ſend me into

ſixe dayes ſince I left it, yet ſhall I not finde any thing therein which

reſiſt her; my Wife and I (which is that ſorrowfull woman that ſits
there) reſolved to goe for the <hi>Indies,</hi> the common refuge of poore
Gentlemen; and having embarqued our ſelves but ſixe dayes ſince in a
ſhip of Adviſe, we had no ſooner put out of <hi>Cadiz,</hi> but that
thoſe two Veſſells of the Pirates, tooke our ſhippe, and wee become
their ſlaves. Whereupon our miſerie was renewed, and our misfortune
confirmed. And it had beene greater, had not the Pirates taken that ſhippe of
<hi>Portugal,</hi> who entertained them ſo long, till that ſucceeded which
you have ſeene.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ricaredo</hi> then asked him, what was his daughters name?</p>
            <p>He anſwered, <hi>Iſabella.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With this <hi>Ricaredo</hi> ceaſed to be confirmed further

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that which before he
ſuſpected; which was, that he who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted this unto him, was his beloved
<hi>Iſabella's</hi> Father; and without giving him any tydings of her, he
told him, that very willingly hee would carry him and his Wife to
<hi>Mundolin,</hi> where happily they might heare ſome newes of that which
they ſo much deſired. He made them preſently go aboord his own ſhip,
leaving Marriners and ſouldiers ſufficient in that of
<hi>Portugal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That night they hoyſed ſayle, and ſet themſelves to get
off from the coaſt of <hi>Spaine;</hi> and for that in the ſhip wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
were the freed Captives, there were likewiſe 20 <hi>Turks,</hi> whom
<hi>Ricaredo</hi> had alſo ſet at libertie; for to ſhew, that more out of
his owne noble diſpoſition, and generous minde, he had dealt ſo
graciouſly with them, then infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by that love which he bare to the
Chriſtians; hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated the <hi>Spanyards</hi> at their parting, that upon
the firſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion that ſhould offer it ſelfe, they ſhould ſet the
<hi>Turkes</hi> at liberty, wherein they ſhould ſhew themſelves
thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unto him.</p>
            <p>The winde, which gave good tokens of being large, 
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:58406:119"/>and proſperous, began to bee very much calmer, which
calme did ſtir up a great tempeſt of feare in the Marriners and Souldiers;
who blamed <hi>Ricaredo,</hi> and his bounty, not ſticking to tell him, that
they whom hee had freed, might give adviſe of their ſucceſſe in
<hi>Spaine;</hi> and that if happily they ſhould have their Galeons lying
there in the Haven, they might put forth to Sea in fearch of them, and ſo put
them to a narrow ſtreight, and in danger of loſing, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their
lives, all that Treaſure which they had got.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ricaredo</hi> knew very wel that they had reaſon on their
ſide, but overcomming all of them with good words, he made them quiet; but
that which did moſt quiet them, was the winde which returned againe to
re-infreſh it ſelfe in ſuch ſort, that having as fayre a gale as could
blow in the skie, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>apt on all
their ſayles, without having need to ſtrike any one of them, or but in the
leaſt manner to reſtraine them; within Nine dayes they came within ſight
of <hi>Mundolin.</hi> And when they were returned home thus vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious, there
were thirty wanting of thoſe that went that Voyage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ricaredo</hi> would not enter the River with tokens of joy, by
reaſon of the death of his Generall; and therefore mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his joyfull, with
ſorrowfull ſignes. One while the Trumpets ſounding loud, and ſhrill;
and another while low, and hoarſe; one while the Drummes did beat lively, and
the Flutes goe merrily, and another while dead, and ſoftly, anſwering each
other with mournefull and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table notes. On one of the Cages of the
ſhippe hung the contrary way, a flagge embroydered with halfe Moones; and on
another, a long ſtreamer of blacke Taffata, whoſe points did mocke the
water.</p>
            <p>In concluſion, with theſe and the like contrary extreams, they
entered the River with their own ſhippe, becauſe the other drew ſo much
water, that the River could not beare
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, and therefore lay at anchor
in the Sea.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:58406:119"/>Theſe ſuch contrary ſignes and tokens,
held a world of people in ſuſpence, who beheld them from each ſide of the
ſhoare. They knew very well by ſome Armes and Coats in their Colours, that
that leſſer ſhippe was the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall wherein the Lord of
<hi>Lanſac</hi> went; but they could not gueſſe how that other ſhippe
ſhould come to be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for that great vaſt ſhippe which lay at Sea.
But they were quickly put of this doubt, by <hi>Ricaredo's</hi> leaping out of
his boat on ſhoare in rich and reſplendent Armes, like a Souldier; who a
foot, without ſtaying for any other company, attended onely with the
innumerable vulgar that followed him; he went directly to the Court, where the
Queene being in a Gallerie, ſtood expecting the newes ſhould be brought her
of her ſhips.</p>
            <p>There was, beſides many other Ladies, with the Queen
<hi>Iſabella,</hi> apparelled after the Iſland faſhion, though with a
little touch of the <hi>Spaniſh.</hi> Before that <hi>Ricaredo</hi> came,
there came another, who told the Queene that <hi>Ricaredo</hi> was come.
<hi>Iſabella</hi> hearing the name of <hi>Ricaredo,</hi> began to change
colour, and ſeemed to bee ſomewhat troubled, and in that very inſtant did
feare and hope, both the evill and good ſucceſſe of his comming.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ricaredo</hi> was tall of ſtature, a gentleman, and well
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned, and for that hee came Armed with his Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, Corſelet, and
Powderns, all <hi>Millaine</hi> worke, richly gilded and ingraven, it became
him extreamely well, and did pleaſe the eyes of the beholders. He had no
Caske on his head, but a broad brim'd hat of a Lyon colour, with a great large
feather, diverſified with a few different colours; a broad ſhort ſword by
his ſide, a very rich girdle and han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and his breeches ſomewhat large,
and full, like unto thoſe of the <hi>Swizzers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being thus acoutered, what with the goodlineſſe of his
preſence, and ſtatelineſſe of his gate, ſome were ſo taken
therewith, that they compared him to <hi>Mars</hi> the god of Warre; and others
taken with the beautifulneſſe of his<pb n="232" facs="tcp:58406:120"/>countenance
compared him to <hi>Venus,</hi> who for to put a jeaſt upon <hi>Mars,</hi>
had put this diſguiſe upon him. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, he came before the
Queene, and humbling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe on his knee, he ſayd unto her.</p>
            <p>Moſt renowned, and redoubted Soveraigne, in the ſtrength of
your good fortune, and in the conſecution of my deſire; after that our
Generall the Lord of <hi>Lanſac</hi> was dead of an Apoplexie, I ſucceeding
in his place (thankes be rendered therfore to your Majeſtie) I lighted by
chance on two <hi>Turkiſh</hi> gallies, which went towing away that great
ſhippe which I have now brought home, and lyes not far off ſafe in the
roade. I did ſet upon them, your Souldiers fought as they alwaies uſe to
do, very manfully; we ſunck both the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Veſſells, and in
one of ours, I gave in your Majeſties royall name libertie to the
Chriſtians, which eſcaped out of the hands of the <hi>Turkes.</hi> Onely I
brought along with me one man, and a woman, both <hi>Spanyards;</hi> who out of
their owne liking and election, were wonderfully deſirous to come with me
into our Iſland, that they might ſee the greatneſſe of your
Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Perſon, and Court. That ſhippe which is now yours, is a
<hi>Portugal,</hi> one of thoſe great Carricks which come from the
<hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> the which by a ſtorme came to fall into the power of
the <hi>Turkes;</hi> who with little trouble, or to ſay better, none at all,
made her to yeeld her ſelfe unto them; and as I am informed by ſome of
thoſe <hi>Portugals</hi> that came in her, ſhe is worth above a Million in
gold, and Spice, and other rich Merchandize of Pearles, and Diamonds, which are
in her, whereof nothing hath hitherto beene toucht, neither did the
<hi>Turkes</hi> come to finger any thing therein; becauſe Heaven hath
dedicated it wholy unto you, and I have commanded it to bee kept and reſerved
whole and entire for your Majeſtie; which with one jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell onely that your

            <p>That very night, accompanied with many boats, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and

            <p>And when he began to ſpeake of the libertie which in her
Maieſties name he had given the <hi>Turkes,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi>
hee ſayd unto her. That Woman, and that Man who ſtand there (pointing to
<hi>Iſabella's</hi> Parents) are they whom yeſterday I told your
Maieſtie, who out of the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire which they had to ſee your
greatneſſe, and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence; did ſo earneſtly entreate mee that I
would bring them along with mee. They are of <hi>Cadiz,</hi> and by that which
they have told me, and by that likewiſe which I have ſeene and obſerved
in them, I know that they are of eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall ranke, and worth.</p>
            <p>The Queene commanded them that they ſhould draw neere unto her;
<hi>Iſabella</hi> lifted up her eyes that ſhee might ſee theſe who
ſayd they were <hi>Spainyards,</hi> and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of <hi>Cadiz;</hi>
out of a deſire that ſhe had to learne if hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily they knew her Parents.
And juſt as <hi>Iſabella</hi> lifted up her eyes, her Mother fixed hers
upon her, and ſtood ſtill a while, that ſhe might view and behold her the
more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively. And on the other ſide there began to be awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in
<hi>Iſabella's</hi> memorie, ſome certaine confuſed notions, which gave
her to underſtand, that heretofore ſhe had ſeen that Woman which ſtood
before her. Her Father was in the like confuſion, without daring to determine
to give credit to that truth which his eyes repreſented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ricaredo</hi> was very attentive to ſee and obſerve the
affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and motions of theſe three doubtfull and perplexed ſoules,
which were ſo confounded and amazed, between the yea and nay of knowing each

               <hi>Iſabella</hi> thus troubled, not
knowing well what to thinke of it, did earneſtly wiſh that ſhee would
ſpeake, whom ſhe imagined might be her Mother; for peradventure her cares
would put her out of that doubt whereinto her cies had put her. The Queene
willed <hi>Iſabella</hi> that ſhe ſhould ſpeake <hi>Spainiſh</hi> to
that woman, and that man; and they ſhould tell her what was the cauſe that
moved them not to accept and enioy that their libertie which <hi>Ricaredo</hi>
had given them; being that libertie is a thing above all other, the deareſt
and beſt beloved, not onely of reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but of thoſe that

tell you, I know not whether you did well in ſo <pb n="239" facs="tcp:58406:123"/>doing.
For we ſee by experience, that a ſudden joy as ſoon kills, as a ſudden
ſorrow. And having ſaid this, ſhe turned her ſelfe to
<hi>Iſabella,</hi> and tooke her apart from her Mother, who having a little
water ſprinkled in her face, came again to her ſelfe; and calling her wits
a little better about her, humbling her ſelfe on her knees before the Queene,
ſhee ſayd unto her.</p>
            <p>I beſeech your Majeſtie to pardon my boldnes, for it is no
mervaile that I ſhould forget my ſelfe, and loſe my ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, with the
over much joy I have received in the finding out this my beloved pledge.</p>
            <p>The Queene made anſwer, that ſhe had a great deale of reaſon
on her ſide (making uſe of an Interpreter that ſhe might the better
underſtand her.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iſabella</hi> came in this manner (as I told you before) to
the knowledge of her Parents, and her Parents of her; whom the Queene commanded
to reſide in the Court, to the end that

leiſure, both ſee, and talke with their Daughter, and rejoyce and make
merry with her. Wherewith <hi>Ricaredo</hi> was wonderfull well pleaſed, and
craved anew of the Queene, that ſhe would be pleaſed to make good her
promiſe, by beſtowing <hi>Iſabella</hi> upon him, in caſe hee did
deſerve her; and if not, hee humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought her Majeſtie, that ſhee
would bee pleaſed preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to put him upon ſome other employment, that
might make himſelfe worthie of obtaining that which he ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly

            <p>The Queene underſtood very well, that <hi>Ricaredo</hi> reſted
well ſatisfied of himſelfe, and of his great valour; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that there
needed not onely new prooſes for to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie him. And therefore told him,
that foure dayes from that preſent being fully ended, ſhe would deliver
<hi>Iſabella</hi> unto him, doing both of them all the grace and honour ſhe

had deſerved <hi>Iſabella,</hi> and that within ſo little a while ſhe
was to be given unto him for Wife, he was ready to runne into deſpaire, and
to offer violence to himſelfe, But before that he would goe about to uſe
ſo infamous and cowardly a remedie, hee brake with his Mother, entreating her
that ſhe would ſpeake unto the Queens to give him <hi>Iſabella</hi> to
bee his Wife; which if ſhee did not bring to paſſe, that he would then
have her to know and aſſuredly beleeve, that death ſtood knocking at the

            <p>The Mother wondred to heare ſuch words fall from her Sonne, and
for that ſhe knew the roughneſſe of his harſh nature, and head-ſtrong
condition, and the faſtneſſe wherewith theſe deſires did cleave unto

Children,) ſhee promiſed to preferre his pretenſion to the Queene, though
not with any hope to obtaine ſuch an impoſſibilitie of her, as the
breaking of her Princely word; but that ſhee might not omit to try in ſo

            <p>And {hIſabella} being that morning apparrelled by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from

untill that ſhe had granted her requeſte, and that then ſhee would make
it knowne unto her. The Queene longed to know the cauſe of that her demand.
And therefore after that the Lady had obtained that which ſhe much deſired,
ſhee recounted to her Majeſtie the love that her Son bare to
<hi>Iſabella;</hi> and how that ſhe feared that if ſhe were not given him
to wife, he will either grow deſperate to his utter undoing, or doe ſome
ſeandalous act or other. And that whereas ſhee had craved thoſe two dayes
of delaying the buſineſſe, it was only to this end and purpoſe, that
her Majeſtie might have time to thinke upon ſome courſe, what might in

            <p>The Queene made anſwer, that if ſhe had not paſt unto her

that <hi>Ricaredo</hi> would come to the window that hee might ſpeake a word
with him; who at that inſtant was all in his gallantrie, like a bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome,
and was even upon the point of going to Court, with ſuch company as ſuch a
ſolemnitie required. But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard a loud call, and being told who he was
that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto him, and in what kinde of faſhion he came; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſomewhat troubled with it, he came to the window; whom as ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ne as <hi>Arneſto</hi> ſaw, he
ſayd unto him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ricaredo,</hi> hearken well unto that which I ſhall now tell
thee. My Miſtreſſe the Queene commanded thee to goe forth in her
ſervice, and to doe ſuch noble exploits as ſhould make thee worthie of
deſerving, the not to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralelled, incomparable <hi>Iſabella.</hi> Thou
didſt goe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnedſt with thy ſhippes laden with gold, wherewith
thou thinkſt that thou haſt bought, and deſerved <hi>Iſabella.</hi> And
albeit the Queene my Miſtreſſe hath promiſed her unto thee; it was as
being perſwaded, that there was not any one in Court that hath done her
better ſervice, nor any that with better title may deſerve
<hi>Iſabella;</hi> and herein it may very well bee that ſhe was deceived.
And therefore leaning to this opinion, which I hold for an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved truth, I
tell thee; that thou haſt neither done ſuch things as may make thee to
deſerve <hi>Iſabella;</hi> neither canſt thou doe any which may be able
to raiſe thee to ſo great a heighth of happineſſe. And therefore in
regard that thou nor doeſt, nor canſt deſerve her; if thou ſhalt avouch
the contrary, I challenge thee the field, and defie thee to the death. And here
the Earle ended his ſpeech; and <hi>Rica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redo</hi> made anſwer thereunto
after this manner.</p>
            <p>This challenge (my Lord) doth in no manner of wiſe concerne mee;
for I ingeniouſly confeſſe, that I not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not deſerve
<hi>Iſabella;</hi> but that there is not that man now living in the world
that doth deſerve her. So that I confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that to be true which you
ſay, this your challenge no way toucheth me; yet notwithſtanding I accept
of it, for<pb n="244" facs="tcp:58406:126"/>that your in ſolencie, and indiſcretion
which you have ſhowen in this your challenging of me.</p>
            <p>And with this he withdrew himſelf from the window, and called in
all haſte for his Armes. This unexpected eroſſe accident much troubled
his Parents, and all thoſe that were come to <hi>Clotaldo's</hi> houſe, to
accompany <hi>Ricaredo</hi> to the Court.</p>
            <p>Amongſt thoſe many that had ſeene the Earle
<hi>Arneſto</hi> armed, and had heard the challenge he had made; there were
not ſome wanting who acquainted the Queen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. Who commanded the
Captaine of her Guard that he ſhould go preſently and apprehend the Farle.
The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine made ſuch good haſte, that he came juſt in the very nicke,
when as <hi>Ricaredo</hi> was going out of his houſe, armed with thoſe
armes wherein he diſimbarqued, being moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on a goodly Horſe.</p>
            <p>When the Earle ſaw the Captaine of the Guard, he forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
imagined the cauſe of his comming; and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (if poſſibly he could
avoyd it) not to be apprehended. And ſpeaking aloud to <hi>Ricaredo,</hi>
ſayd.</p>
            <p>Thou now ſeeſt <hi>(Ricaredo)</hi> the impediment which
hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders us from deciding this quarrell. If (notwithſtanding this
interruption) thou ſhalt have a minde to chaſtiſe mee, thou wilt ſeeke
after me; and I ſhall have the like minde to chaſtiſe thee, and ſeeke
likewiſe after thee; and ſince two that ſeeke after each other, are
eaſily found; let the execution of our deſires ſurceaſe for the
preſent.</p>
            <p>Content, replied <hi>Ricaredo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this time the Captain was come in with all the Guard, and told
the Earle that he muſt yeeld himſelfe his Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; for in her
Majeſties name he was to apprehend him. The Earle yeelded himſelfe unto
him; and told the Captain that be ſubmitted himſelfe to her Majeſties
Command; but with this condition, that he ſhould not carry him to to any
other place, ſave the Queenes Preſence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:58406:126"/>The Captaines emained therewith ſatisfied,
and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in the midſt of the Guard, brought him to Court before the
Queene. Who had alreadie been informed by his Mother, of the great love which
her Sonne bare to <hi>Iſabella;</hi> and with teares beſought her
Majeſtie that ſhee would pardon the Earle, who being a young man, and
deepely in love, was lyable to farre greater errours. <hi>Arneſto</hi> was
brought before the Queene, who without entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning any ſpeech with him,
commanded his ſword to be taken from him, and afterwards ſent him to
Priſon.</p>
            <p>All theſe things tormented the heart of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> as
like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of her Parents, who ſo ſuddenly ſaw the ſea of their
quietneſſe troubled.</p>
            <p>The Ladie of the Bed-chamber, <hi>Arneſto's</hi> Mother
adviſed the Queene, that for to remove that miſchiefe betwixt her houſe,
and that of <hi>Ricaredo,</hi> that the cauſe thereof might be taken away;
which was <hi>Iſabella,</hi> by ſending her into <hi>Spaine,</hi> and ſo
thoſe effects would ceaſe, which now were to be feared.</p>
            <p>Whereunto the Queen anſwered; that for the ſending of her into
<hi>Spaine,</hi> ſhe ſhould treate no more on that point; becauſe her
faire preſence, and her many graces and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, gave her great content; and
that doubtleſſe, if not that very day, the next following, without all
faile ſhee would marry her to <hi>Ricaredo,</hi> according to the promiſe
ſhe had made him.</p>
            <p>With this reſolution of the Queenes; <hi>Arneſto's</hi> Mother
was ſo diſ heartened and diſcomforted, that ſhee replied not ſo much
as one word. And approving that for good, which ſhe had alreadie forecaſted
in her minde, that there was no other way, no other meanes in the world, for
the mollifying of that rigorous condition of her Sonne, nor for the reducing of
<hi>Ricaredo</hi> to tearmes of peace, ſave by taking away of
<hi>Iſabella.</hi> She determined to put in practiſe one of the greateſt
cruelties that could ever enter into the thought of any noble woman, and
eſpecially ſo prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall<pb n="246" facs="tcp:58406:127"/>a one as ſhe was. And this
her determination was, to make away <hi>Iſabella</hi> by poyſon. And
becauſe it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the condition of women to be ſpeedy, and reſolute
in what they goe about; that very evening ſhe gave <hi>Iſabella</hi>
poyſon in a certaine Conſerve, forcing her in a manner to take it, telling
her that it was excellent good againſt thoſe paſſions of the heart,
wherewith ſhee ſeemed to bee troubled.</p>
            <p>Having ſatisfied her importunitie, within a little while after
that <hi>Iſabella</hi> had taken it, her tongue and her throate began to
ſwell, and her lippes to grow blacke, her voyce hoarſe, her cies troubled,
and her ſtomacke and bowells tormented with gripings; all manifeſt ſignes
and tokens that ſhe was poyſoned.</p>
            <p>The Ladies came to the Queene, acquainting her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie how it
was with her; and certifying her, how that the Ladie of her Bed-chamber who had
the charge of <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi> had done her this ill office. There needed
not much preſſing to induce the Queene to beleeve that it was true; and
therefore went preſently to ſee <hi>Iſabella,</hi> who was almoſt
breathing her laſt.</p>
            <p>The Queene commanded her Phiſitians ſhould be ſent for in
all haſte, and in the meane while before they came, ſhe cauſed a
quantitie of the powder of <hi>Vnicornes-horne</hi> to be given her, and ſome
other preſervatives againſt poyſon, which great Princes uſe alwaies to
have readie at hand, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the like caſes of neceſſitie. The Phiſitians
came and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied their beſt remedies, and beſought the Queene that ſhee
would bee pleaſed to cauſe that Ladie of her Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber to make know he
unto them what kinde of poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that was which ſhe had given her; for it
was not to be doubted that any other perſon but her ſelfe had poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
her. She did diſcover what ſhee had given her; and having notice of it, the
Phiſitians applied ſo many and ſuch effectuall remedies, that by them and
Gods helping hand, <hi>Iſabella</hi> remained with life, or at leaſt in
good hope of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:58406:127"/>The Queene commanded her Bed-chamber woman
to be apprehended, and to be lockt up in a ſtreight and harrow lodging in her
Court, with intention to puniſh her according to the nature and qualitie of
this her foule offence. Although that ſhe ſought to excuſe her ſelfe by
ſaying, that in killing <hi>Iſabella</hi> ſhe did ſacrifice to the
gods, by ridding the earth of a Chriſtian; and together with her, removing
the occaſion of her Sonnes further quarrells.</p>
            <p>This ſad newes being brought to <hi>Ricaredo,</hi> made him
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt out of his wits; ſuch were the things he did, and ſuch were the
complaints he made.</p>
            <p>In concluſion <hi>Iſabella</hi> did not loſe her life, yet
the poyſon had gotten that power over her, that ſhe loſt the hayre of her
head, and of her eye-browes, her face was ſtrangely pufft up, the graine of
her skinne ſpoyled, her complexion marred, her whole body mightily ſwolne,
and her eyes diſtilling watry humours. In a word, ſhe was growne ſo foule
and ill favoured; that ſhe, who till then ſeemed to be a miracle of
beautie, did now ſeeme to be a monſter of uglineſſe. And they who knew
her before, held it the greater misfortune of the two, that ſhe remained in
this evill plight, then if ſhe had dyed of the poyſon. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all this, <hi>Ricaredo</hi> ſued a new unto the Queene for her, and
beſought her Majeſtie that ſhe would give him leave to carry her home to
his houſe, becauſe the love which he bare her, paſſed from his bodie to
his ſoule; yet comforted himſelfe with this, that though
<hi>Iſabella</hi> had loſt her beauty, yet could ſhe not loſe her
infinite vertues.</p>
            <p>Thou ſayeſt true, replyed the Queene, goe take her home with
thee <hi>Ricaredo,</hi> and make account that thou carryeſt with thee a
moſt rich jewell in a courſe caſe. I would have given her as fayre to
thee, as thou deliveredſt her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me. But ſince this is not poſſible,
forgive <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that fault; happily
the chaſtiſement which I ſhall give to the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this foule
offence, ſhall in part ſatisfie thy deſire of revenge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:58406:128"/>Many things did <hi>Ricaredo</hi> ſay unto
the Queen, ſeeking to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> the
Ladie of her Bed chamber, beſeeching her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie to pardon her, ſince
that the reaſons ſhe alleadged in her excuſe, were ſufficient for to
move her to forgive her greater exceſſes then theſe.</p>
            <p>In concluſion, <hi>Iſabella</hi> and her Parents were
delivered unto him, and <hi>Ricaredo</hi> carried them home, I meane to his
Fathers houſe. To thoſe rich Pearles, and that Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, the Queene added
other jewells, and other chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of rayment, which were ſuch and ſo
coſtly, that they diſcovered the great love which ſhe bare to
<hi>Iſabella,</hi> who remained for the ſpace of two moneths, without being
able to be reduced to her former beautie. But the time being paſt, her skinne
beganne to peele and fall away, and a fayre and ſmoothe graine of skinne to
diſcloſe it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>In this interim, <hi>Ricaredo's</hi> Parents preſuming that it
was not poſſible that <hi>Iſabella</hi> ſhould become the ſame woman
which heretofore ſhe was; reſolved to ſend for that Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn Damoſell,
with whom before that ever they treated with <hi>Iſabeſla, Ricaredo</hi>
(by agreement) was to marry. And all this they did without his knowledge, not
doubting, but that the preſent be autie of this new bride, would blot out of
his Sonnes remembrance, that of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> which was now paſt; whom
either they purpoſed to ſend into <hi>Spaine,</hi> together with her Father
and Mother, giving them ſuch ſtore of wealth and riches, as ſhould fully
recompence their former received loſſes.</p>
            <p>There paſſed not above a moneth and a halfe, when as without
<hi>Ricaredo's</hi> privitie, the new ſpouſe entred within his Fathers
doores, accompanied like her ſelfe, very well, and ſo fayre and beautifull
a creature, that next to <hi>Iſabella,</hi> when ſhe was in her prime,
there was not the like unto her in all <hi>Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

beds-ſide where <hi>Iſabella</hi> lay; and finding her onely accompanied
with her Father and Mother before them, he ſpake unto her after this
manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iſabella</hi> of my ſoule; my Parents out of the great
love which they beare unto mee, being not as yet well infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of that
exceeding love which I ſtill beare unto thee, have brought a Damoſell into
this houſe, with home they have treated and concluded to marry mee, before
that I ſhould know the worth that is in thee, or that thou ſhouldſt
recover thy loſt health. And this they have done (as I verily beleeve) with
intention, that the great beautie of this Damoſell ſhould blot thine out of
my ſoule, which is therein ſo deepely engraven. I <hi>(Iſabella)</hi>
from the very inſtant that I lov'd thee, it was with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of love
then that which hath its ayme, and end, in ſatisfying the ſenſuall
appetite. For albeit, that thy corporall beautie did captivate my ſences; yet
thy infinite vertues were they which impriſoned my ſoule; ſo that if
being fayre I did love thee, being now foule I adore thee. And for the further
confirming of this truth, give me this hand, and ſhe giving him her right
hand, and and he holding it faſt in his, proſecuted his ſpeech, ſaying.
By that faith which my Chriſtian Parents taught mee; and by that true God who
heareth what we ſay, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe thee (my deare <hi>Iſabella</hi>) the one
halfe of my heart, I vow my ſelfe thy Husband, and am ſo even from this

            <p>
               <hi>Iſabella</hi> remained in ſome ſuſpence upon theſe
words of <hi>Ricaredo,</hi> and her Parents amazed and aſtoniſhed; ſhe
knew not what to ſay, nor doe any other thing, fave<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

telling him with a voice intermingled with teares, that ſhe accepted him for

kiſſed<pb n="250" facs="tcp:58406:129"/>that her foule face, which when it was fayre,
he durſt never preſume to touch. <hi>Iſabella's</hi> Parents with tender
and many teares ſolemnize this nuptiall feaſt. <hi>Ricaredo</hi> told them,
that he would put off his marrying with the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne Damoſell which was now
in the houſe, in ſuch manner as he would hereafter give them to
underſtand. And in caſe that his Parents ſhould ſend all three of them
into <hi>Spaine,</hi> that they ſhould not decline it, but by all means get
them goe; and that they ſhould looke for him within two years, either in
<hi>Cadiz</hi> or <hi>Sevilla;</hi> aſſuring them in the word of a
Gentleman, that ere that time were expired, hee would not fayleto bee with
them, if Heaven ſhould ſo long lend him life: and that if the time prefixed
ſhould be proterlapſed, they ſhould then reſt aſſured, that ſome
great impediment or death, which was the more certaine, had croſſed his
intended journey.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iſabella</hi> made him anſwere, that ſhee would not
ſtay onely two yeares for him, but all thoſe of his life, all that ſhe
were truely certified, that he had left this life. And that, in that inſtant
that this ſhould come to her knowledge, the ſame likewiſe would be her
death.</p>
            <p>With theſe kinde words, freſh teares fell from them all. And
<hi>Ricaredo</hi> went and told his Parents, that he would by no meanes be
marryed, nor give his hand to the Northern Damoſell to be his Spouſe, till
he had quieted his minde by a yeares travell. He knew well how to expreſſe

            </p>
            <p>In fine, the Queene tooke ſuch good ſecuritie of the Merchant,
that ſhe made no doubt of the true payment of it. And not contenting her
ſelfe with this, She ſent for the Maſter of a Flemiſh ſhippe that lay
in the River, and was to put forth the day following for <hi>France,</hi> onely
to take teſtimonie thereof in ſome Port, that hee might bee the better able

            <p>The Maſter who deſired to give the Queene content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, told
her that he would doe it, and that he would land them either in <hi>Lisborne,

            <p>The next day came <hi>Iſabella,</hi> with her Father and Mother
to take their leave of the Queene, who received them with a great deale of

of the Shippe; and deſiring <hi>Iſabella</hi> to advertiſe Her, of her
ſafe arrivall in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and from time to time, of her well-fare, by

            <p>At this their taking of their leaves, <hi>Ricaredo</hi> was not

payment would prove good of the tenne thouſand Crownes; which were to bee put
to the account of the French Merchant, who had undertaken for to ſee it
disburſed. Two dayes after their arrivall at <hi>Sevilla,</hi> they enquired
after him, and found him, and gave him the French Merchants letter, he did
acknowledge the bill; but told them that untill he had received letters from
<hi>Paris,</hi> and a letter of adviſe, hee could not let them have the
money, but yet that he looked every moment to be advertiſed thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iſabella's</hi> Parents had hyred a very fayre houſe,

her, he needed not to give himſelfe any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trouble then to on quite

becauſe this token could not eaſily be forgotten.</p>
            <p>It was forty dayes before letters of adviſe came from

was for her beautie throughout the whole Citie.</p>
            <p>By the order of the French Merchant of <hi>Sevilla,
Iſabella,</hi> and her Parents writ letters to the Queene of the North
Iſle, of their ſafe arrivall in <hi>Spaine;</hi> with ſuch
acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſubmiſſions at her Majeſties feet, as the many
favours from her received, did require. They likewiſe writ to
<hi>Clotaldo,</hi> and to his Ladie <hi>Catalina, Iſabella</hi> ſtyling
them her Father and Mother, and her father and mother them their lords. From
the Queen they received no anſwer, but from <hi>Clotaldo</hi> and his Wife,
they did; whom in their letters gave them the <hi>parabien</hi> of their ſafe
arrivall Certifying them beſides, how that their Son <hi>Ricaredo</hi> the
next day after that they had hoiſed ſaile, was gone for <hi>France,</hi>
and from thence to paſſe to ſome other parts of Chriſtendome, whether
it was fitting for him to go, for theſe ttling and ſecuring of his

love, and affection, beſides many other fayr and friendly offers. To which
letters of theirs, they made anſwere with another, no leſſe couteous and
loving, then thankefull.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iſabella</hi> preſently imagined, that <hi>Ricaredo's</hi>
leaving his Countrey, was to come to ſeeke her out in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and
feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſelfe with this hope, ſhe beganne to lead the moſt contented

<hi>Ricaredo</hi> ſhould come to <hi>Sevilla,</hi> he might ſooner heare
the good report that went of her vertues, then come to the knowledge of her
houſe. Seldome or never did ſhe goe out of doores, unleſſe it were to
the Monaſterie; ſhe reaped no benefit by any other Iubilees, ſave thoſe
which ſhe gained by the Monaſterie. From her houſe, and from her
oratorie, ſhe went more with her meditations, then her foot. She never

hardly bee reduced to any number. But ſpent all her whole time in
retyredneſſe, in prayers, and good deſires, ſtill looking for the
comming of her <hi>Ricaredo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This her great retyredneſſe, did ſet on fire and inflame the
deſires, not onely of thoſe young gallants of that ſtreet where ſhe
dwelt, but of all thoſe that had but once had a ſight of her. Hence grew
night muſicke at her window, and day careers with their <hi>Iennets.</hi> And
from this her not ſuffering her ſelfe to be ſeene, and from others much
deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to ſee her, encreaſed their ſeeking out of cunning Bawdes
which were Miſtreſſes in their Art, and promiſed to ſhew themſelves
no leſſe in ſoliciting <hi>Iſabella.</hi> And there were not ſome
wanting, who endeavoured to bring this their wicked purpoſe to paſſe by
witch craft, charmes, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetie, and the like lewd courſes. But againſt all
theſe, <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi> was like a rocke in the midſt of the Sea,
againſt which the waves and the windes daſh and beare, but doe not move
it.</p>
            <p>A yeare and a halfe was now paſt, when the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hope of
thoſe two yeares promiſed by <hi>Ricaredo,</hi> began with more
earneſtneſſe then hitherto it had done, to vexe and grieve the heart of
<hi>Iſabella.</hi> And whiles ſhee was now and then thinking with her
ſelfe that her Husband was come, and that ſhe had him before her eyes, and
asked him what was the cauſe that hindered his comming, and had kept him ſo
long from her. And while againe ſhe imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the juſt excuſes that
<hi>Ricaredo</hi> made her for his long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and how willingly ſhe did
beleeve, and receive them, and how lovingly ſhee embraced him in her armes,

was thinking on theſe love fancies, a letter came to her hands from the
La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die <hi>Catalina,</hi> bearing date from <hi>Mundolin</hi> ſome 50. dayes
ſince. It was written in the tongue of the Iſland

            <p>Daughter of my ſoule, thou knoweſt very well <hi>Guillarte
Ricaredo's</hi> Page, he went along with him in this his journey. And by a
Former of mine unto you, I advertiſed you, that <hi>Ricaredo</hi> made for
<hi>France</hi> the ſecond day after your depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and from thence was to
travell farther. Now this his ſervant <hi>Guillarte</hi> at the end of
ſixteen moneths; in all which time, we had no newes of our Sonne, came home
to us yeſterday, and brought us theſe ſad tydings, that the Earle
<hi>Arneſto</hi> had by treacherie killed <hi>Ricaredo</hi> in
<hi>France.</hi> Now then (Daughter) conſider in what caſe his Father, my
ſelfe, and his Spouſe are in with this heavie newes; being ſuch, I ſay,
that they have not left us any hope of putting this our misfortune in doubt.
That which <hi>Clotaldo,</hi> and my ſelfe entreate of you againe, and
againe, is; that you will truely and earneſtly remember <hi>Ricaredo,</hi>
who well deſerveth this good office from you, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering how dearely hee
loved you, as you your ſelfe beſt know. You ſhall likewiſe begge of
God, that hee will give us patience, and bring us to a good death; to whom wee
likewiſe will make the ſame requeſt; and humbly beſeech him, that hee
will give unto you, and your Parents, many long and happie yeares of life.</p>
            <p>By the letter, hand, and ſeale, there was not any the leaſt
doubt left to <hi>Iſabella,</hi> for not giving credit to the death of her
Husband. She knew very well his Page <hi>Guillarte,</hi> and knew that hee was
true and truſtie, and that in his owne nature hee hated a lye, and that he
had no reaſon in the World for to feigne that his death; and as little, his
Mother Ladie <hi>Catalina;</hi> being that it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported nothing to ſend her
ſuch ſorrowfull newes. In concluſion, no diſcourſe that ſhee could
make with her ſelfe, nothing that ſhee could imagine, could put it out of
her thought, that this unfortunate newes was not true.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:58406:133"/>Having ended the deading of his letter

her ſorrow, moderating it with the reſolution which ſhee had put on,
ſhe fell to comforting of her Parents, to whom ſhee diſcovered her
intent. But they did adviſe her, that ſhee ſhould not put it in
execution, untill that thoſe two yeares were over paſt which
<hi>Ricaredo</hi> had ſet downe for the tearme of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming; for thereupon

<hi>Deane</hi> of the Church, and the <hi>Vicar-generall</hi> of the
<hi>Arch-biſhop,</hi> and all the Ladies and gentlemen of title and qualitie
that were in the Citie; ſo great was the deſire that all of them had, to
ſee that ſunne of <hi>Iſabella's</hi> beautie, which had ſo many
moneths beene ecclipſed. And becauſe it is the cuſtome and faſhion of
thoſe Damoſells which goe to take the habit, to bee as gallant and as
bravely adorned as poſſibly they can deviſe; who as one, that ever after
from that inſtant ſets up her reſt, and takes her leave and farewell of
all braverie, and wholy diſcards it. <hi>Iſabella</hi> was willing (that
ſhe might not breake ſo ancient a cuſtome) to tricke and ſet forth her
ſelfe in the beſt and moſt curious manner that poſſibly ſhe could
invent. And therefore ſhe did put on that gowne and kir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and thoſe rich
dreſſings which ſhe had on when ſhee went to Court, which we have
heretofore told you, how rich, how ſightly, and how magnificent it was. There
came forth to publicke view, thoſe orient Pearles, and that glittering
Diamond, with the Carkanet, chaine, and girdle, which likewiſe were of great
valew.</p>

               <hi>Iſabella</hi> went out of her houſe on foot, for her being
ſo neere unto the Monaſterie, excuſed Coaches, and Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. The
concourſe of the people was ſo great, that it repented them that they had
not taken Coach, for they would not give them way to get to the Monaſterie.

called <hi>Aquapendiente.</hi> And in an Inne where I alighted, I found the
Earle <hi>Arneſto,</hi> my mortall enemie; who with foure ſervants went
diſguiſed, and went (as I conceive) to <hi>Rome,</hi> I did verily beleeve
that he had not knowne me, I ſhut my ſelfe up in my lodging with my

did not doe it, becauſe the great careleſeneſſe which I obſerved in
the Earle, and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, did aſſure me that he did not know me. I
ſupt in my lodging, I made faſt the doore, ſtood upon my guard with my

goe to bed. My ſelfe and my ſervant lay downe on a bench to take a little

            <p>But a little after midnight, they awakened me with pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to

plate; as likewiſe my bill of exchange for a thouſand and ſixe hundered

Chriſtian Captive a <hi>Spanyard,</hi> who kept them ſafe; for if they had
once come to the <hi>Turkes</hi> fingering, I ſhould at leaſt have given

<hi>Argiers,</hi> where I found the Fathers of the order of the bleſſed
<hi>Trinitie,</hi> treating of the redeeming of Chriſtian Captives; I ſpake
with them, I told them who I was; and moved out of charitie, though I was a
ſtranger unto them, they redeemed mee in this forme and manner fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.
They gave for mee three hundered Ducats, one hundered to be layd downe
preſently; and the other two, at the next returne of the Shippe that ſhould
come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme the Father of that ſociety, who remained in
<hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers,</hi> engaged in foure thouſand Ducats more then thoſe that
hee brought with him; for to ſuch great pittie and compaſſion extended
the charitie of theſe men, that they give their owne, for other folks
liberty, and remaine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Captives, for to free others from
Captivitie. And for an addition of this happineſſe of my libertie, I found
my loſt boxe, with my certificates, and my bill alſo of Exchange. I
ſhewed it to that holy Father who had ranſomed me, and I offered him five
hundered Ducats more then my ranſome came to, towards the payment of his
engagement.</p>

<hi>Eſtremadura,</hi> iſſued a Gentleman borne of noble Parents; who like
another Prodigall, through divers parts of <hi>Spaine, Italy,</hi> and
<hi>Flanders,</hi> went ſpending and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting as well his yeares, as his
wealth. And in the end, after his many peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grinations, and travells, (his
Parents being alreadie dead, and his patrimonie conſumed;) he came at laſt
to reſide in the great Citie <hi>Sevilla</hi> where he found ſuſſicient
occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to waſte and conſume that little of his ſubſtance which he
had left.</p>
            <p>Now ſeeing himſelfe in ſome want of moneys, and not having
many friends, he had recourſe unto that remedie whereunto many other decayed
perſons, and ſuch an are broken in their eſtates commonly have reconſe.
To wit, to goe for the <hi>Indies;</hi> the defuge and protection of all your

<pb n="270" facs="tcp:58406:139"/>of Banker-rupts, the ſafe conduct of murtherers, the
cloake and cover for your cunning gameſters, to whom ſome give the name of
cheaters; the common lure whereunto your looſer women ſtoope, the generall
deceiving of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and the particular relieving of few.</p>
            <p>In concluſion, comming thither in that time, and juſt as it
were in the very nicke when as the Fleet was putting forth to ſea, to make
for the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> or <hi>Tierra-Fume</hi> (as the
<hi>Spanyards</hi> call it) having agreed with the Admirall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, (upon

bidding <hi>Spaine</hi> fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well. They weighed anker, and with a generall joy
(ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as faire a winde as heart could wiſh) they hoyſed ſaile, and it

proſperouſly ploughing the waves in thoſe ſpacious plaines of that

            <p>This our thoughtfull paſſenger revolving in his minde, and
calling to his remembrance the many and diverſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which in thoſe

himſelfe; and ſeing what a bad reckoning he was like to make of it, did put
on a firme and conſtant reſolution to change his former courſe of life,
to turne over a new leafe, and to alter his wonted ſtyle in ſpending, and
to looke a little better then heretofore he had done, to that wealth and meanes

               </gap> in a manner
becalmed, when <hi>Fels pede Carrtzales</hi> (for that is his name who
miniſters occaſion of <pb n="271" facs="tcp:58406:139"/>matted to this our ſtory) had
this ſtorme and tempeſt within himſelfe Well, the winde returned to take
new breath, putting the ſhips forward with ſuch force and violence, that
they left no man ſurely ſetled in his place. And therefore
<hi>Carrtzales</hi> was inforced to leave his imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to ſuffer
himſelfe to becarried away with thoſe cates onely, which this his voyage
offered unto him; which was ſo ſucceſſefull, that without receiving any
by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, or hinderances, they happily arrived at the Port of
<hi>Cartagena.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for to let paſſe all that which maketh not for our
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe; I ſay that when <hi>Felipe</hi> went for the
<hi>Indies,</hi> hee was 48. yeares old. And in thoſe 20. enſuing years
whilſt he remained there; by his induſtry and diligence, hee grew to bee
worth a hundered and fifty thouſand Ducats.</p>
            <p>Now then, ſeeing himſelfe in ſo rich and plentifull an
e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, touched with that naturall deſire which all men have to returne
home to their owne native Countrey, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding the great proffers, both for
his private profit, and his publicke preferment which were offered him. Leaving
<hi>Peru,</hi> where hee had gotten ſuch great ſtore of wealth bringing it
along with him, all in barres of gold and ſilver, and ſeeing it
regiſtred, for to quit all inconveniencies, hee returned for <hi>Spaine,</hi>
landed at <hi>S. Luears,</hi> and came unto <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villa,</hi> as well laden
with yeares, as wealth. What hee brought thence appropriated to himſelfe, at
the unlading of the Galleons he had quiet poſſeſſion given him,
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any the leaſt diſturbance or interruption of officers. He inquired
after his friends, and found them all dead; he had a great minde to goe to his
owne Countrey, though he had aheady received newes that death had not left him
any one kinſman alive.</p>
            <p>And if when he went for the <hi>Indies</hi> poore and
neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, many thoughts troubled his braines, not ſuffering him to
be at quiet one minute of an houre in the midſt of the waves of the Sea, no
leſſe did they now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> him
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<pb n="272" facs="tcp:58406:140"/>on land, though the cauſe were different, for
then he could not ſleepe for thinking on his poverty, he could not now take
any reſt for thinking on his wealth. So heavie a loade is riches to him that
hath not beene acquainted therewith, nor knowes not how to uſe them, as
poverty into him who lives in continuall want. Gold brings cares with it, and
cares oppreſſe him who wants it, but the one are remedied by having ſome
moderate quantitie thereof; and the other augmented, by having too much of
it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carrizales</hi> his minde did runne often upon his wodges of
gold, and did as often eye them, but not that he was miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, becauſe in
thoſe few yeares wherein he had beene a Souldier and followed the warres, he
had learned to be free, and liberall, but what he ſhould doe with them,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe for to keepe them ſtill in their being, would be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
unprofitable, and to keepe them at home in his houſe, would be but a bayte
for the covetous, and a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting prey for theifes.</p>
            <p>The deſire of returning to the troubleſome and unquiet trade

thought of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie, but inſtantly ſuch a great feare came upon him;
that as a Cloud is ſcattered and driven away by the winde, ſo vaniſhed
this his thought. For in his owne naturall diſpoſition, hee was the moſt
jealous man in the world, though being as yet unmarried; and now with onely the
bare imagination of being a married man, jealouſies began to offend him,
ſuſpicions to trouble him, and ſtrange fancies to vexe and torment him;
and with ſuch great effecacie and vehemencie, that hee was now quite off the
hinges, and fully reſolved with himſelfe never to Marrie.</p>

ordained it, that paſſing one day along the ſtreete, he ſhould eaſt

cauſe given him to ſhake and tremble, and to be afflicted with more and
greater cares, then ever he had beene trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with heretofore.</p>
            <p>And the firſt manifeſtation which he made of his jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
condition, was; that he would not ſuffer a Taylour to take meaſure of
thoſe many changes of garments which hee was minded to make for this his
young wife. And therefore went eying, if hee could meet with any other woman
that was little more or leſſe of the ſame ſize and ſtature,
anſwerable to that of <hi>Leonora;</hi> at laſt he lighted on a poore Mayd,
neere about her pitch; cauſing a Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour that was a very good workeman, to
take meaſure of her, and to make one whole ſute fitting to her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die; that
done, bringing it to his wife, he wiſhed her to put it on; ſhee did ſo.
In fine, hee found that it did fie her to a hayre; and thereupon, according to
that meaſure, hee cauſed the reſt of her cloathes to be made; which were
ſo rich, and ſo many, that the Parents of the eſpouſed, held
themſelves exceeding happie, in having lighted upon ſo good a Sonne in Law,
both for their owne, and their Daughters better good and maintenance.</p>

            <p>The ſecond token of his jealouſie was, that hee would not bed
his wife, till hee had brought her home to his owne houſe, which hee had
ordered in this forme and manner. He bought one, which coſt him Twelve

perceived that the <hi>Negro</hi> was alreadie very at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive; and drawing
neere to the hindge of the doore, in alow voyce he called unto him, ſaying; I

I am ready to periſh for thirſt; and am ſo drie, that I am not able to

            <p>No, I cannot (replyed the <hi>Negro</hi>) though my life lay upon
it; for I neither have the key to this doore, nor is there any the leaſt hole
or crannie whereby to give it thee.</p>
            <p>Who then (ſayd <hi>Loayſa</hi>) hath the key? My maſter
(an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the <hi>Negro,</hi>) who is the moſt jealous man in the World.
And if he ſhould but know that there were any bodie now ſpeaking here with
me, it were as much as my life were worth, he would not let me live one houre

            <p>I (replied <hi>Loayſa</hi>) am a poore cripple, lame on one of

getting my living by begging for Gods ſake, an almes of good and

them in ſuch manner, that the wards may remaine imprinted in the waxe. And

cunning Locke ſmith, a friend of mine, to make the keyes accordingly; and
ſo in the night I may come in unto thee, and teach thee to play better then
<hi>Preſter Iohn</hi> of the <hi>Indies;</hi> for it is a thouſand pitties,
that ſuch a voice as thine ſhould be loſt, for want of being holpen by

ſome inſtruments, be it either Ghitterne, Lute, Harpe, Organ, or the like.
But that which will fit beſt with your voice, is that of the Ghitterne, for

inſtruments.</p>
            <p>I am of your minde for that (replied the <hi>Negro,</hi>) but that

            <p>No by no meanes (ſayd <hi>Loayſa,</hi>) it was the leaſt of

is drunke with meaſure, doth never cauſe any harme. Nay I drinke it with

which being fill'd to the very brimme, holds juſt three quarts, and no more,

            <p>
               <hi>Loayſa</hi> was ſcarce gone from the doore, when as with
match more nimbleneſſe then his crutches promiſed, hee haſtened to give
an account to his companions and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellets, of this his good beginning, as
a prognoſticke of the good end which hee hoped for. He met with them,
fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them altogethe, and recounted unto them what hee had concluded with
the <hi>Negro.</hi> And the next day following, he fitted him with ſuch
inſtruments, as ſhould pull out any nayle, or knap it aſunder, as if it
were ſome ſmall ſticke. But in the meane while, <hi>Loayſa</hi> was not
careleſſe in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to give the <hi>Negro</hi> muſicke; nor was the

if it were not looked on with a malicious and ſuſpicious eye, it could

            <p>The ſecond night <hi>Loayſa</hi> gave him thoſe

throwing<pb n="289" facs="tcp:58406:150"/>his crutches away from him, as if hee had not any
infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie at all, he began to cut two or three capers, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at the
<hi>Negro</hi> was much more amazed then before, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring what manner of man
this ſhould bee, and to what end or purpoſe hee had put on this
diſguiſe. To whom (to put him out of his muſing) <hi>Loayſa</hi>
ſayd;</p>
            <p>Know (brother <hi>Luys</hi>) that this my lameneſſe, and
numb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, does not grow from any infirmitie that I have, but of ſet
purpoſe, I feigne my ſelfe to bee thus ill affected whereby I get my
living, and bread to put in my mouth, begging for Gods ſake. And helping my
ſelfe with this tricke, and my muſicke, I picke out a pretty meanes to
maintaine my ſelfe, and leade the merrieſt life of any man in the world;
whereas they who are not their craft-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and uſe not the like kinde
of induſtrie, are readie to ſtarve, and often dye out of meere hunger. And
this thou ſhalt finde to be true, as in the diſcourſe of this our
new-founded friendſhippe I ſhall diſcover and make clear unto thee.</p>
            <p>Time will ſhew it, anſwered the <hi>Negro;</hi> in the meane
while let us take order to put this plate againe in its owne place, that what
wee have done may not bee diſcerned. With a very good will, replyed
<hi>Loayſa;</hi> and ſo taking nayles out of his wallet, they faſtened
the plate ſo neatly to the locke, that it was juſt the ſame as it was
before; wherewith the <hi>Negro</hi> reſted wonderfull well contented. And
ſo <hi>Loayſa</hi> going up to the <hi>Negro's</hi> loft, accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated
himſelfe the beſt hee could. <hi>Luys</hi> preſently tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a waxe
candle, and without any longer tarrying, <hi>Loayſa</hi> drew out his
Ghitterne, and playing upon it with a ſoft and ſweete touch, ſuſpended
the <hi>Negro</hi> in ſuch ſort, that hearing it, hee was almoſt out of
his little wits. Having played a pretty while, hee tooke out a new collation,
and gave it unto his Scholler, who in ſwallowing downe his ſweet meats, 
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:58406:151"/>dranke ſo deepe of the bottle, that it made him more
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides himſelfe then the muſicke.</p>
            <p>This being paſt and ended, hee would in all haſte, that
<hi>Luys</hi> ſhould beginne to take out his firſt leſſon; and
becauſe the poore <hi>Negro</hi> had foure fingers thicke of wine ſwimming
in his braine, hee could not hit right upon any one of the frets, or make any
true ſtoppe; and yet notwithſtanding <hi>Loayſa</hi> made him beleeve
that he had learned alreadie two tunes, and the jeaſt was that the good
ſilly <hi>Negro</hi> did verily thinke ſo indeed. And all that night, hee
did nothing elſe but fumble on a Ghitterne out of tune, and worſe ſtrung,
wanting its moſt neceſſarie ſtrings thereunto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing.</p>
            <p>That little of the night which was left them, they ſlept. And
about ſixe in the morning <hi>Carrizales</hi> came downe and opened the
middle doore, and likewiſe that towards the ſtreete, and ſtood wayting
there for the <hi>Diſpenſero,</hi> who came anone after; and putting in the
proviſion for the houſe at the <hi>Tornell,</hi> hee went thence and
cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the <hi>Negro</hi> that hee ſhould come quickly downe and take in
the provender for the Mule, and with it his allowance for himſelfe. Which hee
had no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner done, but old <hi>Carrizales</hi> went his way in great
haſte, leaving both doores lockt, not perceiving that which was done in that
towards the ſtreete; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Maſter, and his Scholler were not a
little glad thereat.</p>
            <p>Scarce had the Maſter of the houſe got him out of doores, but
hee haſtily ſnatcht up the Ghitterne, and began to play ſo loud thereon,
that all the Maydes in the houſe heard the ſound thereof; and calling unto
him, askt him at the <hi>Tornell.</hi> What is this <hi>Luys?</hi> whence had
you this Ghitterne? who gave it you? Who gave it mee (anſwered <hi>Luys</hi>)
the beſt Muſitian living in the world, and one that hath faithfully
undertaken to teach me<pb n="291" facs="tcp:58406:151"/>in loſſe then ſixe dayes,
more then ſixe thouſand tunes. But where is this Muſitian ſayd the old
beldame that was mother of the maydes? Not farre off, replied the
<hi>Negro,</hi> and if it were not for ſhame, and the feare I have of my
Maſter; peradventure I could ſhew him you with a wet finger, and I vow you
would be very glad to ſee him. But where may he be, that we may ſee him,
anſwered the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine ſince that into this houſe never entered any other
man, ſave our owne Maſter. You ſay well Miſtreſſe (ſayd the
<hi>Negro</hi>) but I will ſay nothing till you ſee that which I know,
ſure I am he hath taught me what I told you, in ſo ſhort a ſpace.
Certainely (ſayd the old Dame) if it be not the Devill that hath taught thee,
I know not who can make thee turne ſo good a Muſitian, in ſo ſhort a
time. Go, get you gone (quoth the <hi>Negro</hi>) for one of theſe dayes, you
ſhall both heare, and ſee him. That cannot bee, replied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother of the
maydes; for we have no windowes out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſtreete, either to ſee, or
heare any thing. Very good, quoth the <hi>Negro;</hi> but yet let me tell you,
that there is a remedie for all things, ſave againſt death; and ſo much
the rather, if you can, or know how to hold your peace. Hold our peace,
(replied one of the ſlaves,) we will bee more ſilent, then if were dumbe. I
aſſure thee (brother <hi>Luys</hi>) that like one that hath a longing, I am
readie to dye, to heare a good voice; for ſince that we have beene here mewed
up like ſo many Hawkes, we have not ſo much as heard the ſinging of
birds.</p>
            <p>All this prattle <hi>Loayſa</hi> heard, to his paſſing great
content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it ſeeming unto him, that they all tended to the perfecting of
his purpoſe; and that good fortune had put to her helping hand, in cutting
out the doth according to the meaſure of his owne will. The Maydes went their
way upon the <hi>Negro's</hi> promiſing them, that when they leaſt thought
on it, hee would call them to heare a very good voice. And fearing leaſt his
Maſter ſhould returne, and finde him talking with them; he left them for
the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,<pb n="292" facs="tcp:58406:152"/>retyring himſelfe to his lodging. Hee
would feigne have beene tampering with a new leſſon, but he durſt not
touch the Ghitterne in the day time, leaſt his Maſter might chance to heare
him, who came a little while after; and ſhutting the doores as he was wont,
lockt himſelfe up in his houſe.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Negro</hi> had his dinner given him that day at the
<hi>Tornell, Luys</hi> ſayd to the <hi>Negro</hi> that brought it him; that
that night after that his Maſter was a bed and aſleep, they ſhould all
come downe to the <hi>Tornell,</hi> and that without all ſayle they ſhould
heare the voice he promiſed them. True it is, that before he told them this,
hee had with moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt entreaties beſought his Maſter that he would
be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to play and ſing that night at the <hi>Tornell,</hi> that he
might make good his word, and cumply with the promiſe hee had made, that the
Maydes ſhould heare an admirable voyce; aſſuring him, that he ſhould be
much made of by all of them.</p>
            <p>His maſter after a great deale of entreating, yeelded at laſt
to doe that which the <hi>Negro</hi> or rather himſelfe ſo much deſired.
Howbeit he made ſhew that it was onely at his ſchollers requeſt, and to
give him content, without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intereſt of his owne. The <hi>Negro</hi>
embraced him, and gave him a kiſſe on the cheek, in token of the
contentment, which that his promiſed favour had cauſed in him; and that day
he feaſted <hi>Loayſa,</hi> and made him better cheere then peradventure he
ſhould have found at home.</p>
            <p>The night came, and in the midſt thereof, little more or
leſſe, they began to heare a whiſpering about the <hi>Tornell;</hi>
whereby <hi>Luys</hi> preſently underſtood, that the whole packe of them
were gathered there together. And calling to his Maſter, they came both downe
from the Hay-loft, with a well ſtrung but better tuned Ghitterne.
<hi>Luys</hi> ask't who, and how many there were of them that were to heare
him? They anſwered, they were all there ſave only their Miſtris who was
in bed with her husband; for the which <hi>Loayſa</hi>
               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:58406:152"/>was very ſorry; yet notwithſtanding, hee was willing to give an
induction to his deſigne, and to give ſatisfaction to his ſcholler; and
ſo touching with a ſoft and gentle hand his Ghitterne, he did play ſo
ſweetly, that the <hi>Negro</hi> won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered thereat, and the women that heard
him were ravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed therewith. What ſhall I ſay? they thought when they
heard him play <hi>loth to depart,</hi> and that taking tune of the
<hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabanda,</hi> the neweſt then in <hi>Spaine.</hi> There was not the
oldeſt amongſt them which did not fall a dancing; nor the yongeſt which
did not tricke it with their armes a kembo; but very ſoftly, and with a
ſtrange kind of ſilence, having ſet Sentinels, and ſpyes, to give them
notice, if the old man ſhould chance to wake.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Loayſa</hi> likewiſe ſung a merry pleaſant Ballad,
wherewith he ſealed up the eares of his <hi>Auditors,</hi> who earneſtly
intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Negro,</hi> that hee would tell them, who was this ſo rare
a Muſitian? The <hi>Negro</hi> told them; That he was a poore beggar, but
withall, the gallanteſt, and braveſt gentleman, of all that beggerly
Corporation in <hi>Sevill.</hi> They then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him, that he would ſo
order the buſineſſe, that they might come to have a ſight of him, and
that for a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night he ſhould not let him goe out of the houſe, and that
they would entertaine him all that while very well, and that he ſhould lack
nothing, that was needfull for him. Then they asked him, how he came to get him
into the houſe? Hereunto, hee returned them not one word; but told them, that
if they had a mind to ſee him, they ſhould make a little hole in the
<hi>Tornell,</hi> which afterward they might ſtop up with Waxe; and that he
would take it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, to keepe him in the houſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Loayſa</hi> ſpake likewiſe unto them, offering them his
ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, in ſuch good language, that thereby they did perceive, that
ſuch words could not come from the wit of a poore beggar. They intreated him,
that he would repayre ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther night to the ſame place, and that they would
procure their Miſtris to come downe to heare him, maugre the 
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:58406:153"/>light ſleepe of their Maſter, which lightneſſe
grew not from his many yeares, but from thoſe many jealouſies that he had
in his head.</p>
            <p>Where unto <hi>Loayſa</hi> anſwered, that if hee would heare
him without fearing the old mans troubling them, hee would give them a powder
to put into his wine, that ſhould make him ſleepe ſoundly above his
ordinarie time. God bleſſe me ſayd one of the Damoſels, if this prove
true, what good fortune hath entered within our doores, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our dreaming,
or deſerving it. This will not bee ſo much a powder of ſleepe for him, as
a powder of life for all of us; and more particularly for our poore Miſtris
<hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora,</hi> his wife, who is never from her, <hi>ni a ſol, ni a
ſombra,</hi> neither night, nor day, not ſuffering her to bee out of his
ſight one ſole minute. Oh ſweet ſir, if ever you will doe any thing for
us, and that our beſt wiſhes may wait on you in all that you deſire or
endeavour; bring this powder, delay no time, bring it, bring it I beſeech
you, and it ſhall be my taske to mixe it with his wine, I will be his
skinker; and I wiſh it with all my heart that the old ladde may ſleep three
whole dayes, and ſo many nights, that we may have as many of mirth and
jollitie.</p>
            <p>Doubt ye not but I will bring it, ſayd <hi>Loayſa,</hi> and
ſuch a one ſhall it be, that it ſhall do him no other hurt that takes it,
ſave to provoke him to a moſt profound ſleepe. Then all of them joyntly
beſought him, that he would bring it as ſoone as poſſibly hee could.
And ſo reſolving the next night to bore a hole with an augour in the
<hi>Tornell,</hi> and to draw their Miſtris thither, that ſhe might ſee,
and heare him, they tooke their leaves.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Negro,</hi> though it were neere upon breake of day,
would needes take forth a new leſſon which <hi>Loayſa</hi> gave him, and
withall made him beleeve, that of all the ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th at ever he taught, not any one had a better care then

               </gap> what a muſicall note meant. 
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:58406:153"/>
               <hi>Loayſa</hi> his friends tooke it to their care, to
come nightly to liſten between the two doores of the ſtreete, to ſee if
their friend had any thing to ſay unto them, or if hee needed ought; and
making a certain ſigne, agreed upon between themſelves; <hi>Loayſa</hi>
knew that they were at doore, and at the hole before mentioned. He gave them a
ſhort account of the good tearmes whereon his buſineſſe ſtood;
earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entreating them, that they would ſeeke out ſomething that
would procure ſleepe, for to bee given to <hi>Carrizales.</hi> For he had
heard ſome ſay, that there were ſome powders which would worke this
effect. They told him that they had a Phiſitian a friend, that would give
them the beſt that he knew, or had, for that purpoſe. And ſo animating
him to proſecute the enterprize hee had undertaken, and promiſing him to
bring it him the next enſuing night they ſpeedily tooke their leave.</p>
            <p>Night came, and the whole flocke of Pigeons came at the call of
the Ghitterne; together with them, came that ſimple ſoule <hi>Leonora,</hi>
fearefull and trembling leaſt her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ſhould awake; for though ſhe,
overcome with this feare, was not willing to come; yet ſo many perſwa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ons did her ſervants uſe, and more
eſpecially her Governeſſe ſpake ſo much in the praiſe of the
ſweetneſſe of the muſick, and the good diſpoſition of the
Muſitian, that although ſhe had never ſeene him, yet ſhee lifted him up
above the clouds, and preferred him before <hi>Abſalom,</hi> and
<hi>Orpheus.</hi> So that the poore Gentlewoman, convinced, and overſwayed by
them, yeelded to do that which ſhe had no will to do, nor ever would have
had.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing they did, was to bore a hole in the
<hi>Tornell</hi> for to ſee the Muſitian, who was not now in the habit of a
poore mendicant, but in a ſuite of coloured Taffata, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dawbed all over with
gold lace, and a hat anſwerable ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, with exceeding neate linnen in his
band and cuffes wherewith hee came provided in his wallet; imagining that hee
might happily meete with ſome ſuch good occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion<pb n="296" facs="tcp:58406:154"/>wherein it might be fitting for him to change his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite. He was
young, of a gentle diſpoſition, and a good preſence. And (becauſe he
had ſo much time to friend, that all of them had taken a full view of him,)
comparing him with their old Maſter; he ſeemed unto them to be an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell,
one peeped through the augar-hole to ſee him, and then another; and in
concluſion all, one after another. And to the end that they might view him
the better, the <hi>Negro</hi> waving his wax candle, one while this way,
another while that way, from ſide to ſide, from top to toe, gave them a
full and perfect ſight of his perſon.</p>
            <p>Now when as they had made an end of feeding their eyes, and left
further looking on him; <hi>Loayſa</hi> betooke him to his Ghitterne, and
ſung that night ſo farre beyond thoſe other heretofore, that he ſtrucke
them all, old, and young with a ſtrange aſtoniſhment. And all of them
beſought <hi>Luys,</hi> that he would invent ſome meanes how to bring in
his Maſter amongſt them, that they might heare, and ſee him neerer hand,
and not at that diſtance, and through ſo narrow a hole; as likewiſe that
they may bee rid of their feare by being ſo far off from their Maſter, who
might ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly come ſtealing in upon them and take them napping; which
could not ſo ſucceed, if they tooke him into the houſe, and hid him
cloſely amongſt them.</p>
            <p>But this courſe was croſt by their Miſtris, who mainely
withſtood it, and would by no meanes give way to his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance amongſt
them, ſaying; Content your ſelves, can we not as well ſee and heare him
here; ſure I am we may doe both with more ſafetie, and leſſe hazzard of
our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. What doe you talke of honour? ſayd her Governeſſe, the King
hath enough for us all; goe I pray and ſhut up your ſelfe with your
<hi>Methuſalem,</hi> and leave us to make mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and enjoy our ſelves as
we may. And the rather may we give him free entrance, for that he ſeemes to
be ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt a gentleman, that hee will no other thing of us, then what we
will our ſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:58406:154"/>Hence <hi>Loayſa</hi> taking his riſe,
ſayd; Gentlewomen, I am come hither with no other intention, ſave onely to
ſerve you with my ſoule, and my life; condoling with you this your unheard
of, and never untill now ſeene the like cloſe ſhutting up, pittying the
time which in this ſtrickt kinde of life ye loſe. I am a man (I ſweare
unto you by the life of my Parents) ſo milde, ſo meeke, ſo plaine in my
dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, of ſo good a condition, and ſo obedient, that I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do
any thing more then what you ſhall command me. And if any, even the meaneſt
amongſt you ſhall but ſay unto mee, Maſter ſit downe here and
ſtirre not, maſter paſſe to this, or that other place of the houſe,
keepe you cloſe in ſuch a corner, lye downe and wagge not, I will doe as
you bid me, and with more nimbleneſſe and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, then the tameſt dog
that is taught to leape and dance for the King of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If he will doe as he fayes (ſayd the as ignorant as inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent

you but get the print of this middle-doore-key in wax, and againſt to morrow
night, I will get another made like unto it, which ſhall ſerve our turne.
In taking this one key out in waxe, we take out all the reſt to the whole
houſe; becauſe this is the maſter-key that opens and commands all,
anſwered one of the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells. So much the better (ſayd
<hi>Loayſa;</hi>) You ſay true ſayd <hi>Leonora.</hi> But ſir you
ſhall firſt ſweare, that you ſhall not doe any other thing when you are
entered in, ſave onely ſing, and play when you ſhall bee commanded; and
that you ſhall ſubmit your ſelfe to bee ſhut up, and to reſt there
quiet where we ſhall put you, till we releaſe you. I ſweare to keepe all
this truely, anſwered <hi>Loayſa.</hi> Nay, this oath is nothing worth

your father, and by the life of your mother. I ſwear (ſaid

            <p>With this, ceaſed the converſation of that night, all
reſting wondrous well contented with the conſentment which they bad made
amongſt themſelves. And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, who from good to better, went furthering
<hi>Loayſa's</hi> affaires, who brought his friends to that ſtreete two
houred after mid night; who making their wonted ſigne, playing on a
Iewes-trumpe. <hi>Loayſa</hi> ſpake unto them, telling them how things
ſtood with him; and how farre hee had, proceeded in his pretenſion;
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating them that they would bring him the powder, or ſome other thing
which hee had formerly ſpoken for, for to caſt <hi>Carrizales</hi> into a
ſound and deepe ſleepe. Hee acquainted them likewiſe with that of the
maſter key; they told him, that either the powder, or an oyntment ſhould
bee brought him the night following, being of ſuch force and vertue, that the
pulſes and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea being anoynted therewith, would cauſe a moſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie
ſleepe, out of which there was no awaking of a man in two dayes, ſave by
waſhing with vinegar all thoſe parts which had beene annoynted; and that if
hee would give them the key in waxe, it ſhould be made out of hand.</p>
            <p>This ſhort dialogue being ended, they with-drew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and <hi>Loayſa,</hi> and his ſcholler ſlept that little part of the night
which remained. <hi>Loayſa</hi> expecting with great long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which was
to come, to ſee if they would cumply with their word concerning the
promiſed key. And tho time ſeeme ſlow and lazie to thoſe that waite
upon it, yet at laſt it goes along with our thought, and comes to meete in
that point as we would have it, becauſe it never ſtands ſtill, but is
ſtill going on.</p>
            <p>Well, the expected night was now come, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed houre
of repayring to the <hi>Tornell,</hi> whether came all the ſervants of the
houſe, great, and ſmall, blacke, and white, for all of them were deſirous
to ſee this<pb n="299" facs="tcp:58406:155"/>our Muſitian within their
<hi>Seraglio,</hi> but <hi>Leonora</hi> came not. And <hi>Loayſa</hi> asking
for her? anſwere was made, that ſhe was in bed with her Husband, who had
locked the doore of his lodging; and after that hee had thus ſhut it, when he
had layd himſelfe down to ſleepe, he clapt the key underneath his pillow,
and that their Miſtris had told them, that when the old man was fallen faſt
aſleepe, ſhee would take from under him the maſters key, and imprint the
ſame in waxe; and that for that purpoſe ſhee had alreadie prepared it,
and made it ſoft for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; and that within a little while after,
they ſhould come and fetch it at the out ſide of the hole, which was made
of purpoſe in the doore, for a Doe-Cat to come in at. <hi>Loayſa</hi>
wondered much at the wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the old man, yet for all this their
deſire was not daunted.</p>
            <p>Now whileſt they were talking of this ſubject, hee heard the
Iewes-trumpe; hee haſtened to them at that call, and found that they were his
friends, who gave him a little boxe of oyntment, having that property before
ſpecified. <hi>Loayſa</hi> tooke it, and wiſhed them to ſtay a while,
and hee would bring them a patterne of the key. Hee returned backe againe to
the <hi>Tornell,</hi> and told <hi>Leonora's</hi> Governeſſe, who was
ſhee that with moſt earneſtneſſe deſired his enterance of the boxe;
and that ſhee ſhould carry it forthwith to her Miſtris, acquainting her
with the propertie it had; and that ſhee ſhould annoynt her husband ſo
gently with it, that hee might perceive it, and ſhee ſhould ſee it worke
won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. The Governeſſe did ſo, and comming to the Cats hole, ſhee
found that <hi>Leonora</hi> was expecting her, lying all along on the ground,
with her face towardes the hole; whether her Governeſſe being come, ſhe
ſtretched her ſelfe out at length after the ſame manner, and clapping her
mouth to her Miſtris eare, and ſpeaking in a low voyce, told her, ſhe
brought the oyntment, and after what manner<pb n="300" facs="tcp:58406:156"/>ſhe was to
make tryall of its vertue. She tooke the oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and told her Governeſſe
that by no meanes ſhee could come by her husbands keye, for hee had not put
it under his pillow as hee was wont, but betweene the two <hi>Cholcon's,</hi>
and in a manner under the very midſt of his body; but would have have her
tell the Maſter of muſicke, that if the oyntment ſhould worke that effect
as hee ſayd it would, then very eaſily could ſhe take the key from under
him as of as ſhe pleaſed; and therefore it would be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to take
it in waxe. Shee willed her to goe inſtantly and tell him ſo, and that
ſhe ſhould returne backe againe to ſee how the oyntment wrought, for
preſently ſhee would anoynt him therwith. The governeſſe went down and
did her Miſtris meſſage to <hi>Loayſa,</hi> and thereupon he
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed his friends, who ſtood wayting for the key.</p>
            <p>Trembling and quaking very ſoftly, and not daring to draw her
breath; <hi>Leonora</hi> went gently annoynting the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of her jealous
husband, and likewiſe annoynted the windowes of his noſthrills, and when
ſhe came to them, it ſeemed unto her that he did ſtartle at it, and was
almoſt dead for feare, that ſhee ſhould bee taken with the theft in her
hand. In concluſion, in the beſt manner ſhe could, ſhe made an end of
annoynting all thoſe places which they had told her were needfull; which was
all one as to have embalmed him for his buriall.</p>
            <p>It was not long ere the oyntment had given manifeſt ſignes of
its vertue; for anone after the old man began to ſnore ſo loud, that the
muſicke thereof might bee heard without in the ſtreete, which was ſweeter
in her eares, then that of the Maſter in thoſe of the <hi>Negro.</hi> And
yet as one not fully ſecured by that which ſhee ſaw, and heard; ſhe
drew unto him, ſhe jogg'd him firſt a little, and then a little more to
ſee if hee would awake; and grew at laſt to be ſo bold, that ſhe turn'd
him from the one ſide to the other, with out waking him.</p>
            <p>When ſhe ſaw this, ſhe went to the hole in the doore, 
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:58406:156"/>with a voice, not ſo low as before, ſhe called to her
gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, who was there wayting, and ſayd unto her; give me
<hi>albricias,</hi> ſome reward for my good newes. <hi>Carrizales</hi>
ſleepes as ſoundly, as if he were dead. Why then (Miſtris) doe not you
take the key from under him? ſayd the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the Muſitian hath
beene wayting for it this houre, and more. Stay a little (replied
<hi>Leonora</hi>) I am now going for it; and turning up the bed, ſhee
thruſt her hand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the two <hi>Colchon's,</hi> and tooke out the key
from out the midſt of them, without the old mans feeling it. And holding it
in her hand ſhe began to leape for joy, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more adoe, ſhe
opened the doore and preſented it to the governeſſe, who received it with
the greateſt glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and contentment in the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leonora</hi> commanded they ſhould open to the Muſitian,
and being let in they ſhould carry him to the gallery, not daring to bee
farre from thence for feare of what might happen; and that in any caſe they
ſhould take a new oath of him, that he ſhould not doe ought ſave what
they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him, and that if he ſhould not ratifie and confirme it anew,
in no manner of wiſe ſhould they open the doore unto him. It ſhall bee
done (ſayd the Governeſſe,) and I vow unto you that hee ſhall not enter
till that he hath ſworne, and ſworne againe. Doe not limit him (ſayd
<hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora;</hi>) but more eſpecially be you fure that he ſweare by the
life of his father, and his Mother, and by that which hee loves beſt, for
ſo ſhall wee reſt ſecure, and wee ſhall have our fill of hearing him
ſing, and play; and as I live he doth both very delicately. Begone therefore,
without delaying the buſineſſe any longer, leaſt we paſſe away the
night onely in talking.</p>
            <p>The good Governeſſe tucked up her cloathes, ſet her beſt
foot forward, and in a trice came to the <hi>Tornell</hi> where all the people
of the houſe ſtood expecting her. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſhewed them the key which
ſhe brought along with her, ſo great was the contentment they all tooke,
that they<pb n="302" facs="tcp:58406:157"/>all tooke, that they lifted her up above ground
in their armes, crying, <hi>vivat, vivat,</hi> long live our governeſſe.
And much more were they joyed, when ſhee told them that there was no neede of
counterfeiting the key; for accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of the ſleeping of the anoynted old man, they might
have the key as oft as they would. Good, very good ſayd one of the
Damoſells; open this doore I pray, and let this gentleman in, that we may
once ſee him. Be not ſo haſty (replied the governeſſe) there is more
in it then to ſee him, for we muſt take an oath of him, as we did the other
night. He is ſo good, and ſo honeſt (ſaid one of the ſlaves) that he
will not ſticke upon oathes. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the governeſſe opened the doore,
and keeping it halfe open, and halfe ſhut, ſhe called to <hi>Loayſa,</hi>
who had heard every word they ſayd through the hole of the <hi>Tornell;</hi>
who comming to the doore, would have entred all at once, but the governeſſe
ſtopping him by putting her hand againſt his breaſt, ſayd unto him.</p>
            <p>Sir, I would have you to know, that all they who are within the
doores of this houſe, are as true Virgins, as when their Mothers brought them
forth, except my Miſtris. And howbeit I may ſeeme unto you to bee forty
yeares of age, having not as yet ſeen thirty, for I want two moneths and a
halfe of it. And though happily I looke ſomewhat old, I may thanke the many
troubles and croſſes which have followed me; and thoſe you know will adde
one figure more, if not two to our yeares, according as they have beene more,
or leſſe. And this being ſo as it is, it ſtands not with reaſon, that
in exchange of hearing two, three, or foure ſongs, we ſhould put our
ſelves to the hazard of loſing ſo much Virginitie, as is here ſhut up
within theſe walls; for even this <hi>Negra,</hi> whoſe name is
<hi>Guiomar,</hi> is a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.
And therefore ſir, though my heart ſtands well affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted towards you;
before you enter here into our king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> muſt take a ſolemne oath,
that you ſhall doe nothing, ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> what we ſhall ordaine. And if it ſeeme unto
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:58406:157"/>thee, that much is that which wee require; conſider
that much more is that which we adventure. And if in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming hither your
intention be good, you need not to be ſo nice and ſcrupulous in ſwearing.
<hi>Que albuen pagador, no le due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len prendas.</hi> For he that is a good
paymaſter, will never be loth to lay downe a pawne.</p>
            <p>Well, exceeding well hath our Miſtris <hi>Marialonſo</hi>
ſpoken, ſayd one of the Damoſells; and like a diſcreet woman, as well
in this, as all other her actions; and therefore Miſtris if he will not
ſweare, let him not him come in. Hereupon ſayd <hi>Guiomar</hi> the
<hi>Negra,</hi> who could ſpeake a little broken <hi>Spaniſh;</hi> for my
part ſweare, or ſweare not, be he what he will be, let him come in; for
though he ſweare never ſo much, when he is once in, he will forget all his
oathes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Loayſa,</hi> with a great deale of patience and temper,
hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened to <hi>Marialonſo</hi> her long <hi>Harvenga;</hi> and with a
grave re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſedneſſe, returned this anſwere. Certainely, (my much
honoured and reſpected friends) my intention never was, is, or ſhall be
other, ſave to give you liking and content, as farre as my poore abilities
can reach; and therefore ſhall not with an ill will take this oath you
require of me, yet would I rather that you would have truſted me on my bare
word; ſince that being given by ſuch a one as I am, it ſhould have beene
as good, and as warrantable as any bond, or obligation whatſoever. I would
have you to know that under a coarſe caſſocke, may be a Sattin ſuite;
and that a thred-bare cloake, may cover a good drinker. But that all of you may
reſt ſecure of my good deſire, I am reſolved to ſweare like an
honeſt man. And therefore I ſweare by all that, which in its
<hi>Proeame</hi> the true hiſtory of <hi>Charlemaine</hi> containeth,
together with the death of Gyant <hi>Fierabras,</hi> not to tranſgreſſe,
nor goe beyond the bounds of the oath that I have taken, nor to ſwerve from
the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the leaſt and meaneſt of theſe Virgins; upon paine that
if I ſhall either in act, or in my deſire doe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, from this
preſent, till then, and from then till now,<pb n="304" facs="tcp:58406:158"/>I give it
for voide, and of no effect and validitie.</p>
            <p>So farre went <hi>Loayſa</hi> on with his oath, when as one of
the Damoſells, who with attention had given eare unto him, ſpake out aloud,
ſaying; this is an oath to move the hardeſt ſtones to tender pittie; ill
fortune befall me, if I ſuffer you to ſweare any farther, for with that
which you have alreadie ſworne, you may enter into the ſigne of
<hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricorne.</hi> And taking hold of his breeches, ſhe pull'd him in, and
preſently all the reſt came flocking round about him; and one of them went
inſtantly to advertiſe their Miſtris thereof, who ſtood centinell,
obſerving her husbands ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping. And when the meſſenger told her that
the Muſitian was come into the gallery, ſhee was at one and the ſame
inſtant both joyfull, and ſad, and demanded if he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his oath? She
anſwered, yes; and in ſuch a new forme, as never in all her life ſhee had
heard the like. Well (ſayd <hi>Leonora</hi>) if he hath ſworne, we have
bound him faſt enough. Oh how adviſedly was it done of me, to put him to
his oath.</p>
            <p>In this interim, came up all the whole troope, and the Muſitian
in the midſt of them; the <hi>Negro Luys,</hi> and the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gra
Guiomar,</hi> lighting them up the ſtairs. And <hi>Loayſa</hi> no ſooner
ſaw <hi>Leonora,</hi> but hee made ſpeedily towards her, making ſhew to
throw himſelfe at her feete, and tender his ſervice unto her. She continued
ſilent, and by ſignes willed him to riſe; and al of them were as it were
mute, without daring to ſpeak a word, fearing leaſt their Maſter ſhould
heare them; which being taken notice of by <hi>Loayſa,</hi> he told them;
that they might boldly ſpeake aloud, becauſe the oyntment wherewith their
Maſter was anoynted, had that force and vertue, that ſaving the taking away
of life, it made a man for the time, as dead as a doore-nayle.</p>
            <p>I beleeve it ſayd <hi>Leonora,</hi> for if it were not ſo, hee
had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked twenty times ere this; ſince that his many indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
cauſe in him ſhort ſleeps, but ſince that I anoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, he ſnores
like a horſe, Seeing it in ſo (ſayd <hi>Muria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonſo</hi>) 
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:58406:158"/>let us goe to that hall which is right over againſt us,
where we may heare him ſing, and recreate our ſelves a little. Be it ſo
ſayd <hi>Leonora;</hi> but let <hi>Guiomar</hi> ſtay here and watch that
ſhe may adviſe us, if <hi>Carrizales</hi> ſhould chance to awake.
Whereunto <hi>Guiomar</hi> anſwered; the blacke muſt ſtay, whileſt the
white muſt play. The <hi>Negra</hi> ſtayd behinde, the reſt went to the
hall, where there was a rich <hi>Eſtrado,</hi> covered with <hi>Turkie</hi>
Capets, and coſtly Cuſhions whereon to ſit; and placing the Muſitian in
the midſt in a Chaire of Crimſon velvet, they tooke their places and ſate
downe.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Marialonſo,</hi> mother of the maydes, taking a light in
her hand, ſhee began to take a view of <hi>Loayſa</hi> from the crowne of
the head, to the ſole of the foot. Then ſayd one of them; oh what a fine
foretoppe, how well coloured, and how ſtiffe it is! Oh ſayd another, what a
ſett of white teeth hee hath! what a bad yeare will this bee for blanched
Almonds? for his teeth are more cleane and white then they. Then another; oh
what a full and cleare eye hee hath! I ſweare by the life of my mother, that
they are like ſparkling Diamonds. This, commended his mouth, comparing his
lippes to Rubies; ſhee his legge and foote. And all of them together
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſected the ſeverall parts of his bodie, as if they had meant to make
an Anatomie of him. Onely <hi>Leonora</hi> ſhee was ſilent, but tooke a
fuller view of him then any of the reſt, fixing her eyes ſteadily on him;
and the more ſhee lookt on him, the more did hee ſeeme unto her to bee of a
better preſence then her aged Husband.</p>
            <p>Whileſt theſe things went taking up their contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<hi>Marialonſo</hi> tooke the Ghitterne which the <hi>Negro</hi> held, and
put it into <hi>Loayſa's</hi> hands, entreating him that hee would play
thereon, and that ſhee would, ſing a ſong which was then in great
requeſt, and mightily applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in <hi>Sevill.</hi> The burthen of the
ſong which ſhee ſung<pb n="306" facs="tcp:58406:159"/>was; <hi>Mother, keepe me not
under locke and key. Loayſa</hi> cumplyed with her deſire. They all of them
roſe up, and began to prepare themſelves to dance. <hi>Marialonſo</hi>
had the whole ditty by heart, and ſung the ſame with a better will, then
voyce. The Verſes were theſe.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Loayſa</hi> made preſently the beſt ſhift he could to
hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; and the governeſſe ſhe was very attentive in liſtning
whether her Maſter were comming, or no; and not hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any the leaſt
noyſe, ſhe began to take heart, and by little and little, ſtep after
ſtep, ſhee went drawing neerer and neerer to the chamber where her Maſter
lodged, and heard that he ſnored as he did before. And being aſſured that
he was aſleepe, ſhe tuck't up her clothes before, and returned running,
craving <hi>albricias</hi> of her Miſtris, of her Maſters being aſleepe,
whom ſhe willingly rewarded.</p>
            <p>The good governeſſe would not loſe that faire opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
which offered it ſelfe unto her, of being the firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyer of thoſe
good parts which ſhe imagined the Muſitian had. And therefore telling
<hi>Leonora</hi> that ſhe ſhould ſtay a-,while in the hall, till ſhee
went to call him; ſhee left her and went where hee was no leſſe amazed,
then penſive expecting the newes of what was become of the anointed old man,
and what he did. He curſed the falſeneſſe of the<pb n="310" facs="tcp:58406:161"/>oyntment, and complained of the credulitie of his friends, and
accuſed his owne indiſcretion, that he had not firſt made tryall therof
upon ſome other, before his experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it upon
<hi>Carrizales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whileſt he was thinking on theſe things, in comes the
Governeſſe, and aſſured him that the old man ſlept more, and better
then he did before. His heart was much quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted herewith, and was very
attentive to many amorous words which <hi>Marialonſo</hi> uttered unto him,
whereby hee collected her evill intention; and determined with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, to
make her the hooke and line wherewithall to fiſh her Miſtris.</p>
            <p>Now whileſt theſe two were talking together, thereſt of the
ſervants who had hid themſelves in divers parts of the houſe; one bolted
out here, and another there, to ſee if it were true that their Maſter was
awake. And perceiving that all was buried in deepe ſilence, they came to the
Hall where they had left their Miſtris, of whom they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood their
Maſters continuing ſtill aſleepe. And asking for the Muſitian, and the
Governeſſe, ſhe told them where they were; and all of them with the
ſelfe ſame ſilence and ſtilneſſe which they brought with them, went
faire and ſoftly, hearkening at the doore what they two treated of.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Negra Guiomar</hi> was not miſſing at this their
parley, but the <hi>Negro Luys</hi> was wanting, for he no ſooner heard that
his Maſter was awake; but taking his Ghitterne along with him, he haſtned
to hide himſelfe in his Hay-loft, and covering himſelfe over head and eares
with his poore bed-blanket; he ſweated, and did ſo ſweat for feare, one
drop overtaking another, that his ſhirt was dung-wet. And yet for all this,
hee did not forbeare tampering on the Ghit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne, which hee hugged cloſe in
his boſome, wronging the ſtrings with his untunable fingering; ſuch and
ſo great (now fie upon him) was the affection which hee bare to
Muſicke.</p>
            <p>The wenches over-heard the courtings and love trickes 
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:58406:161"/>of the old Beldame, every one of them ſent their bad
wiſhes after her, ſome in one ill favoured phraſe, and ſome in another;
and not any one of them did call her old, but with an addition of Hagge, Witch,
Bawde, and ſome other worſe (if worſe could bee) which for good
reſpects I ſilence.</p>
            <p>But that which moved moſt laughter in thoſe that heard them,
were the words which <hi>Guiemar</hi> the <hi>Negra</hi> ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered; who for that
ſhe was a <hi>Portugueſſe,</hi> ſpake no good <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> yet
very unhappily, and in a ſtrange kinde of witty manner did play upon her,
taxking her looſe and wanton carriage. In effect, the concluſion of the
diſcourſe between theſe two, was; that he would condiſcend to her will,
on condition, that ſhee ſhould firſt deliver up her Miſtris to his
will. She offered to effect what he deſired; ſo that in requitall thereof,
he would cumply with her deſire; for he had alreadie taken ſuch full
poſſeſſion of her ſoule, that ſhe cared not what
impoſſibilities ſhe promiſed, in an i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginary hope of procuring her
own luſtfull pleaſure.</p>
            <p>On theſe tearmes ſhe left him, and went forth to ſpeake with
her Miſtris; and ſeeing at her firſt ſtepping out that all the
ſervants were got together about her doore, ſhee commanded them that they
ſhould with-draw themſelves to their ſeverall lodgings; and that the next
night they ſhould have time enough to enjoy both their wiſhes, and the
Muſitian with leſſe diſturbance, ſince that this night the feare they
were put into, had much abated the edge, and ſowred the ſweetneſſe of
their ſport and jollitie.</p>
            <p>All of them underſtood on what foot the old trot hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and
this was but a ſhift to rid them thence, that ſhee might be left alone by
her ſelfe; yet durſt do no otherwiſe but obey her, becauſe ſhe was
mother of the maydes, and had the rule and command of them.</p>
            <p>The maydes they were gone; the coaſt being now cleare, ſhee
came into the hall to perſwade her Miſtris to yeeld unto
<hi>Loayſa's</hi> will; and that in ſuch partheticall manner 
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:58406:162"/>in a long continued ſpeech, and in ſuch a ſmooth
and well ordred a ſtyle, as if ſhe had ſtudied it many dayes before. She
indeared unto her his gentile carriages, the ſweetnes of his diſpoſition,
the vigour of his youth, his valour, his wit, and his many other graces and
good parts. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more painting forth unto her, how much more ſweete and
pleaſing would the embracements of a young lover be, then thoſe of an old
decrepit husband; aſſuring her of all ſecreſie and duration of delight,
with divers other ſuch like things as theſe, which the Devill had put into
her tongue; ſhadowed over with rethorical colours, and what varniſh
eloquence could lay upon them; ſo demonſtrative and ſo effectuall, as
might have moved not onely the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heart of ſimple and unwary
<hi>Leonora,</hi> but even that of the hardeſt marble. Oh ye ſmooth filed
tongues! Oh ye pleyted vayles! the honourable weare of grave Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, choſen
out of purpoſe for to authorize the roomes, and the <hi>Eſtrados</hi> of
your principall Ladies; how contrary to your place and dutie, do ye exerciſe
this your powerfull, nay rather in a manner enforcing office!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marialonſo</hi> tooke her Miſtris by the hand, and as it
were by force (her eyes being full of teares) brought her thither where
<hi>Loayſa</hi> was; and ſhutting the doore after her, ſhee left them
there together, but went her ſelfe and layd her downe upon the
<hi>Eſtrado,</hi> to ſee if ſhe could take a little ſleep, but for that
ſhee had watched two nights before, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with drowſineſſe, ſhe
fell faſt aſleepe on the <hi>Fſtrado.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, if at ſuch a time and ſeaſon as this a man ſhould
have asked <hi>Carrizales,</hi> had he not beene aſleepe, what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come now
of your well adviſed circumſpections? your fearefull jealouſies? your
wiſe animadverſions? your pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie perſwaſions? your wiſe and grave
admonitions? What of thoſe high wals of your houſe? what of there not
ent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing thereinto any thing that
ſhould have the name, no not the ſhadow of a man? what of your cloſe kept
<hi>Tornell?</hi> your maſter key? and your window without light? and
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:58406:162"/>that your ſtrange and unheard of ſhutting up of all
your people under locke and key? What of that great Dowrie wherewith you
endowed <hi>Leonora?</hi> Thoſe <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galos,</hi> and dainties, wherewith
you continually enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained her? the good uſage and liberall allowance of
your ſervants, and ſlaves? and your not fayling in any one title in all
that which you imagined they could poſſibly wiſh, or deſire? But wee
have told you alreadie, that there was no asking of him theſe and ſuch
other like queſtions, becauſe hee ſlept ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what a longer time then
was needfull and expedient for him.</p>
            <p>But admit hee ſhould have heard all this, and put caſe hee
ſhould have made anſwere thereunto; hee could not have given a better, then
in ſhrinking up his ſhoulders, in knitting of the browe, and in ſaying;
All this building, the ſubtiltie of a wanton and vicious young man, the
wickedneſſe of a falſe and Devilliſh Governeſſe, meeting with the
unadviſedneſſe of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-entreated; and perſwaded young Woman, hath
ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly demoliſhed, and in an inſtant throwne downe to the ground.</p>
            <p>But yet notwithſtanding all this, the vertue and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of <hi>Leonora</hi> was ſuch, that in that time which was moſt needfull for
her, ſhee ſhewed her valour againſt thoſe villanous enforcements, and
baſe ſtrivings of this cunning Impoſtor; and that with ſuch ſtrong
and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull a reſiſtance, that hee was not able to overcome her, but
wearied himſelfe in vaine, ſo that ſhee went away with the victory; and
both of them being quite tyred out, and having over watcht themſelves, fell
faſt aſleepe.</p>
            <p>Now when all was thus huſh and quiet, Heaven had ſo ordered
it; that <hi>Carrizales</hi> in deſpight of the oyntment, awaked; and (as his
uſuall cuſtome and manner was) hee ſtretcht out his armes, and with his
hands went feeling<pb n="314" facs="tcp:58406:163"/>the bed from ſide to ſide, and not
finding therein his beloved Wife; hee leapt out of the bed all amazed and
aſtoniſhed, with much greater nimbleneſſe then his many yeares
promiſed; and when hee found her not in the Chamber, and ſaw the doore
open, and that the key was wanting betweene the Colchones, hee was readie to
runne out of his wits. But recollecting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a little better, hee went
out into the Gallerie, and going thence as ſoft as foot could fall, that hee
might not bee heard, hee came into the Hall where the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſſe was
ſleeping; and ſeeing her all alone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Leonora,</hi> hee made to
the lodging of the Governeſſe, and opening the doore very ſoftly, hee
ſaw that which hee could have wiſht hee might never have ſeene; hee ſaw
that which hee would have held a great happines that hee had no eyes for to
ſee it. Hee ſaw <hi>Leonora</hi> in the armes of <hi>Loayſa,</hi>
ſleeping ſo ſoundly, as if the oyntment had wrought upon them, and not on
the jealous old man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carrizales</hi> had quite loſt the beating of his pulſes,
with the unexpected ſight of what hee ſaw, his voyce clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to his
throat, his armes fell downe through faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo that hee ſtood
ſtill like a <hi>Statua</hi> of cold Marble. And though choller did its
naturall office, ſeeking to quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and revive thoſe his almoſt dead
ſpirits; yet ſorrow did ſo over-ſway his anger, that it would ſcarce
give him leave to fetch his breath. And yet notwithſtanding, would hee have
taken ſuch revenge, as ſo great a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe deſerved; if hee had
any weapon about him wherewith to have avenged himſelfe of the wrong that was
done him. And therefore reſolved with himſelfe to returne backe againe to
his chamber to fetch a dagger; and at his returne, to take out the ſtaines of
his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, with the bloud of theſe his two enemies, and together with
theirs, that of all that infamous rabble of his houſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="315" facs="tcp:58406:163"/>Having put on this honourable and
neceſſarie reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hee returned with the ſelfe ſame ſilence,
and wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe wherewith hee came to his lodging, where griefe and
anguiſh ſo wrung and oppreſſed his ſurcharged heart, that without any
further power to doe any thing, he fell downe in a ſwound upon his bed.</p>
            <p>In this interim the day appeared, and caught theſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
new adulterers, intangled in the net of each others armes.
<hi>Marialonſo</hi> ſhe awaked, and would have gone for that to
<hi>Loayſa,</hi> which for the good ſervice ſhee had done him, ſhee
thought of right appertained unto her. But ſeeing that the day was now fully
in, ſhe was willing to deferre the receiving of her recompence, till the
comming of the night.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leonora</hi> was much troubled and perplexed, ſeing it was
now broad day, curſing her owne careleſſeneſſe, and that of her
accurſed Governeſſe, whileſt both of them with haſtie ſteps hyed
them thither where her husband was; praying to themſelves as they went along,
that they might finde him ſtill ſnoring. And when they ſaw him lying on
the bed, and not a word come from him, they did verily beleeve that the
oyntment continued its working, fince that he ſlept; and with great
rejoycing, <hi>Leonora</hi> and <hi>Maria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonſo</hi> embraced each other.</p>
            <p>Anon after, <hi>Leonora</hi> drew nigher and nigher to her
hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and taking hold of one of his armes, ſhe turn'd him from the one
ſide to the other, to try whether hee would awake, without putting her to the
paines to waſh him with vinegar, as ſhe had beene told was needfull to
bring him againe to himſelfe. But with that tumbling and toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of him
too and fro, <hi>Carrizales</hi> returned from out his ſwounding, and
fetching a deepe ſigh, ſayd with a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table weake voyce; Oh miſerable
and unfortunate man that I am! to what bad tearmes hath my fortune brought
me!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leonora</hi> did not well underſtand what her husband
ſaid,<pb n="316" facs="tcp:58406:164"/>but as ſoon as ſhe perceived that he was
awake, and that he ſpake, wondring to ſet that the vertue of the oyntment
did not laſt ſo long as was ſignified unto them; ſhe came unto him, and
laying her face to his, muching him with ſtrickt embracements, ſhee ſayd
unto him; What ayl'ſt thou ſweet-heart? me thinkes I heare you complaine as
if you were not well.</p>
            <p>The good old man heard the voice of his ſweet enemie, and
opening his eies in a wilde kinde of faſhion like one amazed, and ſtartled
out of ſome fearefull dreame, he fixed them on her with great
earneſtneſſe, and without moving the leaſt haire of his eye-lids, he
looked wiſſely and ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily on her a great while, and then at laſt he
ſayd unto her; Let me entreat thee (my deare) that you preſently out of
hand ſend for your father, and mother to come hither to mee, for I feele I
know not what in my heart which does paine me exceedingly, and I feare it will
ſpeedily ſhorten my life; and I would feigne ſee them before I die.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſſe <hi>Leonora</hi> did certainely beleeve that what
her husband ſayd, was true; thinking that rather the ſtrength of the
oyntment, then that which hee had ſeene, had put him into this trance. And
telling him, what he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſhould be done. She ſent away <hi>Luys</hi>
the <hi>Negro,</hi> willing him that he ſhould forthwith goto her Parents,
and haſten their ſpeedy comming hither, for that the buſineſſe
requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red much haſte, and their perſonall preſence. Having
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the meſſenger,
ſhe came to her Husband, embraced him, kiſſed him, and uſed towards him
greater expreſſions of kindneſſe then ever ſhe had made ſhow of
heretofore; asking him how he did? where his griefe lay? and that with ſuch
tender and loving words, as if he had beene the onely thing in the world which
ſhe moſt loved and eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. He looked on her in the ſame kinde of
wilde man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner before mentioned; every word that ſhe uttered, and every
muching which ſhe made of him, being a lance that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> the heart, and a ſword that

               </gap> ſoule.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="317" facs="tcp:58406:164"/>In this meane while, the governeſſe had
acquainted the ſervants of the houſe, and <hi>Loayſa</hi> with her
Maſters ſicknes; indearing unto them, that it would quickly make an end of
him, ſince that he had forgotten to command the doors towards the ſtreet to
be ſhut, when the <hi>Negro</hi> went forth to call her Miſtris Parents;
wondring withall, why they ſhould be ſent for in ſuch poſt-haſte,
ſince that neither of them had put their foot within that houſe, ſince
they firſt married their Daughter.</p>
            <p>In a word, they were all of them very ſilent, and knew not well
what to make of it, none of them lighting on the true cauſe of their
Maſters ſickneſſe, who ever and anone did fetch ſuch deepe and
dolefull ſighes, as if every ſigh would have broken his heart-ſtrings,
and rent up his ſoule by the roots from his bodie. <hi>Leonora</hi> wept to
ſee him ſigh in ſuch ſort, and he ſmiled to himſelfe, like one that
was not well pleaſed, conſidering the falſhood of her teares.</p>
            <p>Now by this time <hi>Leonora's</hi> Parents were come, and for
that they found the doore to the ſtreet, and that to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Court open,
and the houſe buried in ſilence, and no bodie to be ſeene, they wondred
at it, and could not tell what to thinke of it, no ſmall feares
poſſeſſing their mindes, ſeverall paſſions houſing themſelves
in their diſtracted i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations. Thus troubled, they went to their Sonne in
Law's lodging, and found him (as already hath beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered) with his eies
nailed to his wife, whom he held faſt by the hand, both of them ſhedding
many teares. She, on no other occaſion, ſave ſeeing her husband ſhed
them; and he, to ſee how feignedly his wife did let them fall.</p>
            <p>As ſoone as her Parents were entred within the chamber,
<hi>Carrizales</hi> ſaluted them, and ſayd; I pray ſit you down, and let
all the reſt voyd the roome, onely I will that the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<hi>Marialonſo</hi> ſtay here; they did ſo. And onely theſe five
remaining there without expecting that any body elſe ſhould ſpeake, in a
low and ſoft vocye, (wiping firſt his eyes) <hi>Carrizales</hi> ſpake
unto them after this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="318" facs="tcp:58406:165"/>I am well aſſured (deareſt father and
mother) that it ſhall not be needfull to bring any witheſſes for to make
you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve a truth, which I ſhall deliver unto you. You may very well
remember (for it is not poſſible it ſhould ſlippe out of your memory)
with how much love, and with how great tenderneſſe a yeare now ſince, one
moneth; five dayes, and nine houres, you delivered up unto me your beloved
Daughter, to bee my lawfull wife. Yee likewiſe know what a great dowrie I
made her; which was ſuch, and in ſo liberall a manner, that three or foure
of the ſame qualitie as her ſelfe, might therewith have beene married, with
the opinion of rich. Yee may alſo call to minde the care and diligence I
tooke in apparelling her, and ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning her with all that ſhee can deſire
or imagine; or that I could come to know was moſt fitting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for
her. In like manner (my very good friends) yee have ſeene, how carried away
by mine owne natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall condition, and fearefull of that ill, which
doubtleſſe will bee my death; and experienced by reaſon of my great age,
in the ſtrange and various accidents of the world; I was deſirous to keepe
this Iewell which I had made choice of, and yee gave mee, with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
charineſſe, and warineſſe, as was poſſible for mee to doe. I
raiſed up the walls of this houſe to a great heigth? I tooke away the
ſight and light from the windowes towards the ſtreete; I made double lockes
to the doores; I made ſuch a <hi>Tornell,</hi> as they have at your
Monaſteries; I baniſhed perpetually therefro, all that which had but the
ſhadow, or name of man, or male-kinde. I gave her ſervants and ſlaves to
attend her perſon; nor did I denie them, or her, ought that they did aske of
mee; I made her my equall; I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated with her my moſt ſecret
thoughts, and made her Miſtris of all my wealth and meanes. All theſe were
ſuch workes, being rightly and duely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, as might have fully
ſecured mee of enjoying<pb n="319" facs="tcp:58406:165"/>of that without diſturbance,
which hath coſt me ſo much; and that ſhee ſhould have made it her
ſtudie, not to have given me any the leaſt occaſion of letting any kinde
of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous feare to enter into my thought. But becauſe the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticement
cannot bee prevented by humane diligence, which the divine will of Heaven is
willing to inflict on thoſe who doe not wholy place therein their deſires,
and hopes, it is no marvell that I remaine defrauded in mine. And that I my
ſelfe have beene the Confectioner of that poyſon, which now goes
ſhortning and taking away my life. But becauſe I perceiue the
ſuſpenſion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all of you ſtand, upon theſe words procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
from my mouth; I will conclude the long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ambles of this my diſcourſe,
with telling you in one word, that which is not poſſible to bee uttered in
many thouſands. I tell you then (my noble friends) that all that which I have
ſayd, and done, ends in this; that this woman I found (borne into the world,
for the diſturbing of my quiet, and loſſe of my life) (poynting to his
wife) in the armes of a luſty young man, which is now ſecretly ſhut up in
the lodging of this peſtiferous Governeſſe.</p>
            <p>Scarce had <hi>Carrizales</hi> ended theſe words, when as
<hi>Leonora</hi> having her heart ſuddenly clouded, fell into a ſwound
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene her husbands knees. <hi>Marialonſo</hi> loſt her colour, and
look't as pale as aſhes; and <hi>Leonora's</hi> Parents had ſuch a knot
knit athwart their throats, that it would not give them leave to ſpeake one
word.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Carrizales</hi> going on where hee left, ſayd, the
revenge which I purpoſe to take for this foule affront, is not, nor ſhall
be ſuch as ordinarily in the like caſes are wont to bee taken. And
therefore I will, that as I was extreame in that which I did; ſo likewiſe
ſhall bee the vengeance which I will take, by taking it on my ſelfe, as
moſt cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable in this offence. For I ſhould, and ought to have
conſidered with my ſelfe, that ill could agree and ſort together the
fifteene yeares of this young Woman,<pb n="320" facs="tcp:58406:166"/>with the almoſt
foureſcore of mine; I was he, who like the Silke-worme, wrought the houſe
wherein I muſt dye. Nor doe I blame thee ill adviſed young ſoule, (and in
ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, he bowed downe his head, and kiſſed the cheeke of
<hi>Leonora</hi>) I doe not blame thee, I ſay; becauſe the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions
of ſubtill old Beldames, and the love-trickes of amorous young men, eaſily
overcome and triumph over that little wit which thy few yeares afford. But
becauſe all the world may ſee and know the worth &amp; value of that good
will and affection wherewith I ever lov'd thee; in this laſt paſſage of
my life, I will ſhew it in ſuch ſort, that it may remaine in the world
for an example, if not of goodneſſe, yet at leaſt of ſuch ſimplicitie
of heart, as was never heretofore heard of, or ſeene. And therefore I will
that a Scrivener be preſently ſent for, to make a new my laſt Will and
Teſtament; wherein I will double <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora's</hi> Dworie: and ſhall
entreat her after my dayes are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which will bee but a few; that ſhee
diſpoſe her will (ſince that ſhee may then doe it without enforcing) to
marry with that young man, whom the grey haires of this unfortunate old man
never offended. And ſo ſhall ſhee ſee, that if living I did never goe
one jot from that which I thought might give her content; now dying, I am
deſirous to doe the like; that ſhe may take that felicitie with him whom
ſhee ſeemeth to love ſo dearely. And to you (kinde Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) I
will have a great care to leave you ſo well, and ſo rich, that you ſhall
live plentifully during both your lives. The reſt of my wealth ſhall goe to
godly and pious uſes. Cauſe the Scrivener to come preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto mee,
for the paſſion which hath alreadie taken hold of me, doth ſo
oppreſſe and torment my heart, that it goes encreaſing, and will in a
very ſhort time cut off the thread of my life.</p>
            <p>Having ſayd this, hee fell into a worſe ſwounding then the
former, and fell downe ſo neere to <hi>Leonora,</hi>
               <pb n="321" facs="tcp:58406:166"/>that their faces were joyned each to other. A ſtrange and ſad
ſpectacle for thoſe her Parents, who with mournefull heart and eies looked
on their beloved Daughter, and their kinde Sonne in Law. The naughty
Governeſſe would not ſtay to receive the rebukes and the reprehenſions,
which ſhe thought <hi>Leonora's</hi> Parents would beſtow upon her; and
therefore ſhee got her out of the lodging, and went to advertiſe
<hi>Loayſa</hi> of all what had paſſed; adviſing him, to get him
inſtantly out of the houſe, and that ſhee would take care to certifie him
by the <hi>Negro,</hi> of the ſucceſſe of this buſineſſe, ſince
that now there were no doores, nor keyes to hinder his paſſage.
<hi>Loayſa</hi> was wonder-ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with this ſtrange newes, and
following her counſell, returned to put on his old ragges like a poore
beggar; and haſtned to give an account to his frieds of the ſucceſſe of
his love.</p>
            <p>In the interim that thoſe two were thus tranſported with their
ſeverall paſſions; <hi>Leonora's</hi> Father ſent to call a Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vener,
an inward friend of his, who came juſt at that time that his Daughter and Son
in Law were come againe to themſelves. <hi>Carrizales</hi> made his Will in
that forme and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as wee told you before, without declaring
<hi>Leonora's</hi> errour; more then that for ſome good reſpects, hee
ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly beſought and entreated her that ſhe would marry, in caſe he
dyed, with that young man, whom he had told her of in ſecret.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Leonora</hi> heard this, ſhee fell downe at her
Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands feet, and her heart panting within her breaſt, ſhee ſayd unto
him; Live (my deare husband, and my chiefeſt bliſſe) live many, many
yeares. For albeit you are not bound to beleeve me in ought that I ſhall
ſay unto you, know, that I have not offended you, ſave onely in thought;
and beginning to excuſe her ſelfe, and to recount at large the truth of the
caſe; ſhee could not move her tongue to ſpeake a word more, but fell a
new into a ſwound.</p>
            <p>Being in this diſmayment, her grieved Husband embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced 
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:58406:167"/>her; her loving Parents imbraced her; and all of them
wept ſo bitterly, that they obliged, and even in a manner, inforced the
Scrivener to accompanie them in their teares, who made the Teſtament. Wherein
he left ſufficient main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to all his houſhold-ſervants; hee
manumitted, and ſet at libertie his women-ſlaves, together with the
<hi>Negro:</hi> but to falſe <hi>Marialonſo,</hi> he bequeathed no more,
but her bare wages.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſettled his eſtate, the ſeventh day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he was borne to his grave. <hi>Leonora</hi> remained a very ſad and mournfull
Widow, but was left very rich. And when as <hi>Loayſa</hi> well hoped, that
ſhee would cumply with that (whereof he was not ignorant) which her Husband
had recommended unto her in his Teſtament; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſaw, that within
a ſeven-night after his death, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a <hi>Nunne,</hi> and was
admitted into one of the ſtricteſt Monaſteries of all the Citie; being
fruſtrated of his hopes, and aſhamed to ſhew his face, leſt hee
ſhould be made a laughing-ſtock, and by-word to all that knew him, he left
<hi>Sevill,</hi> and went for the <hi>Indyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leonora's</hi> Parents were full of ſorow, and heavines,
though ſomewhat comforted with that, which their kind ſonne in law had left
them in his laſt Will, and Teſtament. The Maid-ſervants cheered
themſelves, as well as they could, with the liberall Legacies he had given
them; And thoſe his ſhee-ſlaves, together with <hi>Luys</hi> the
<hi>Negro,</hi> reſted the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſatisfied with their infranchiſement
and freedome.</p>
            <p>But that wicked, and accurſed Governeſſe, ſhee was left
(as ſhe well deſerved) very poore, and defrauded of all her evill thoughts,
and lewd purpoſes. And I my ſelfe reſt very well pleaſed, that I am now
come to the end of this ſucceſſe, Example, and Mirrour of the little
confidence, which is to be put in Keyes, Locks, Tornells, and Walls, when as
the will continueth free, and at libertie. And how much leſſe we are to
truſt, and relye on greene and

            <p>Only I doe not know what was the reaſon, that <hi>Leonora</hi>
did not expreſſe her ſelfe more at large, in excuſing her ſelfe, and
in giving her jealous Husband to underſtand, how cleare, and unſpotted
ſhee was, and how cleare from doing him any wrong in that kind: but
perturbation, it ſhould ſeeme, had knit a knot on her tongue, and the
haſte her Husband made to dye, did not give her time enough to make her
juſt excuſe.</p>
